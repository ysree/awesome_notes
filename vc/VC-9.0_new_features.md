## ðŸ§  Detailed Explanations of Highlighted Features

### Memory Tiering over NVMe

* ESXi treats NVMe devices as a secondary memory tier.
* Configurable DRAM:NVMe ratio.
* Not all workloads supported; performance tradeoffs exist.

### TLS 1.3

* Modern, secure encryption by default.
* Reduces handshake latency and improves security.

### Native VPC / VPC APIs in vCenter

* Manage VPCs/subnets directly from vSphere UI.
* Simplifies network management for vSphere admins.

### Monster VM / Scale Increases

* Supports VMs up to 16â€¯TB RAM and 960 vCPUs.
* Useful for large databases, HPC, big data.

### Licensing / Subscription vs Perpetual

* vSphere supports subscription licenses alongside perpetual licenses.
* Improves flexibility for enterprise licensing models.
