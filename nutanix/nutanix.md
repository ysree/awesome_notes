# How to debug ping command. If it is not working how you will debug to find out the root cause for the same.
- Test local interface ‚Üí 127.0.0.1 / self IP.
    ```
    # ifconfig  # or `ip addr`
    # ping 127.0.0.1  # test loopback
    ```
- Test DNS resolution if hostname used.
    ```
    # nslookup google.com  
    # dig google.com
    ```
- Check routing table and default gateway.
    ```
    # ip route show  
    # route -n
    ```
- Ping intermediate devices to isolate failure.
    ```
    # traceroute example.com  # Linux/macOS
    # tracert example.com     # Windows
    ```
- Check firewall / security rules on local and remote.
    - ICMP might be blocked by:
    - Local firewall (iptables, ufw)
    - Network firewall / security group
    - On Linux:
        ```
        # sudo iptables -L -v -n
        # sudo ufw status
        ```
- Try direct IP instead of hostname.
    ```
    # ping <gateway_ip>
    ```
- Use alternative tools to confirm network connectivity.
    - **curl, telnet, nc** ‚Üí test TCP connectivity if ICMP is blocked.
    - **mtr** ‚Üí combines ping + traceroute for continuous monitoring.
- Verify target host status.

# Mounting and Debugging an NFS Filesystem

## Mounting an NFS Filesystem
To mount a filesystem from an NFS server (e.g., IP `192.168.1.100` exporting `/data`) to a local directory (e.g., `/mnt/nfs`), use:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.100:/data /mnt/nfs
```

This mounts the remote directory to the local mount point. To make it permanent, add to `/etc/fstab`:
- FSTAB(file system table)
```bash
192.168.1.100:/data /mnt/nfs nfs defaults 0 0
```

Files in the NFS share can then be accessed as if local.

## Debugging NFS Mount Issues
If the mount fails, follow these steps:

1. **Check Server Reachability**:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.100
   ```

2. **Verify Exported Directories**:
   ```bash
   showmount -e 192.168.1.100
   ```
   If not listed, check the server's `/etc/exports` or NFS service status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status nfs-server
   ```

3. **Check Network and Firewall**:
   Ensure TCP/UDP ports 111 and 2049 are open:
   ```bash
   nc -zv 192.168.1.100 2049
   ```

4. **Verify Server Permissions**:
   Ensure the client‚Äôs IP is allowed in `/etc/exports` on the server, e.g.:
   ```bash
   /data 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
   ```
   Reload exports after changes:
   ```bash
   sudo exportfs -ra
   ```

5. **Check Client Logs**:
   View errors in system logs:
   ```bash
   dmesg | tail -n 20
   journalctl -xe
   ```

6. **Mount with Debug**:
   Use verbose mode for more details:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -v -t nfs 192.168.1.100:/data /mnt/nfs
   ```

7. **Ensure NFS Utilities**:
   Verify `nfs-utils` is installed on the client and the server‚Äôs hostname resolves if using DNS.

# How to validate if two files are the same or not? What attributes of a file can be checked for validation? [e.g. metadata, content]

#### Check file attributes (quick check)
- Before comparing the contents, you can check metadata. Key attributes include:
- File size ‚Äì If sizes differ, files are definitely not the same.
- File type ‚Äì Ensure both are the same type (text, binary, etc.).
- Modification timestamp ‚Äì Can hint if files have changed.
- Permissions/ownership ‚Äì Can help in certain contexts, but not definitive for content.
- Checksum or hash ‚Äì Generate a hash (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) for each file; if hashes match, files are - very likely identical.
- Actual content comparison (diff, cmp)

Given file is in a distributed system and file is open at one node for writing and that file is not allowed to be deleted on any other node. Write the test plans for the same.
# Test Plan: Prevent Deletion of Open File in Distributed System

### 1. Objective
To validate that when a file is open for writing on one node in the distributed system, it cannot be deleted from any other node until it is closed. This ensures data integrity and consistency across the system.

### 2. Scope
- Covers file operations (open, write, delete) across multiple nodes.  
- Focus on file locking, distributed metadata consistency, and deletion restrictions.  
- Applies to shared/distributed filesystems (e.g., NFS, GlusterFS, CephFS, HDFS).  

### 3. Assumptions
- The distributed filesystem provides file locking mechanisms.  
- All nodes share consistent metadata.  
- Delete operation must respect open handles on other nodes.  

### 4. Preconditions
- Distributed system setup with at least 2 nodes.  
- Test file (`testfile.txt`) created and accessible from all nodes.  
- Proper logging and monitoring enabled on each node.  

### 5. Test Scenarios & Steps

#### Scenario 1: Delete attempt while file is open for writing
1. On Node A, open `testfile.txt` in write mode (vim, nano, or programmatic open).  
2. On Node B, attempt to delete the same file (`rm testfile.txt`).  
**Expected Result:** Deletion must fail with a proper error (e.g., *Device or resource busy*, *Permission denied*). File remains accessible on Node A.  

#### Scenario 2: Delete attempt after closing the file
1. On Node A, open and then close `testfile.txt` after writing.  
2. On Node B, attempt to delete `testfile.txt`.  
**Expected Result:** Deletion succeeds because file is no longer open.  

#### Scenario 3: Concurrent write + delete attempts
1. On Node A, start a continuous write process (`dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile.txt bs=1M count=100`).  
2. On Node B, simultaneously attempt to delete the file.  
**Expected Result:** Deletion fails until Node A completes and closes the file.  

#### Scenario 4: Multiple nodes access
1. On Node A, open file for writing.  
2. On Node B, open the same file for reading.  
3. On Node C, attempt to delete the file.  
**Expected Result:** Deletion must fail as long as Node A has the file open for writing.  

#### Scenario 5: Edge case ‚Äì Force delete
1. On Node A, open file for writing.  
2. On Node B, attempt to use `unlink()` or `rm -f`.  
**Expected Result:** Operation must fail or be blocked; file stays intact.  

#### Scenario 6: System crash during write
1. On Node A, open file for writing but do not close. Simulate crash or network disconnection.  
2. On Node B, attempt to delete the file.  
**Expected Result:** Depending on system design ‚Äì deletion should either fail until a timeout/lease expiry or succeed if the lock is released by failure detection.  

### 6. Validation Checks
- File content is not corrupted after delete attempts.  
- Error messages are clear and consistent across nodes.  
- Metadata (inode reference count, locks) is correctly updated.  
- Logs show proper rejection of delete requests during write locks.  

### 7. Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Pass:** Deletion is not allowed when the file is open for writing, and allowed after the file is closed.  
- **Fail:** File gets deleted while still open for writing, or system behavior is inconsistent across nodes.  

### 8. Tools Needed
- `ls -l`, `lsof`, `fuser` for checking open file handles.  
- Logging/monitoring tools for distributed FS.  
- Scripts to automate open-write-delete operations across nodes.

How to check the performance of processes in a UNIX system?

# Checking Process Performance in UNIX

This guide explains how to monitor and check the performance of processes in a UNIX system.

---

### 1. Basic Process Monitoring
- **List processes by CPU usage:**
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10
  ```
- **List processes by Memory usage:**
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
  ```
- **Real-time monitoring (CPU, Memory, Processes):**
  ```bash
  top
  ```
- **Interactive process viewer (if installed):**
  ```bash
  htop
  ```

---

### 2. CPU Performance
- **Check system load average:**
  ```bash
  uptime uptime or w ‚Üí Shows system load average (1, 5, 15 minutes).
  ```
- **Historical CPU usage (requires sysstat):**
  ```bash
  sar -u 1 5
  ```

---

### 3. Memory Usage
- **Check memory and swap:**
  ```bash
  free -m
  ```
- **Monitor memory, CPU, I/O, and processes:**
  ```bash
  vmstat 1
  ```

---

### 4. I/O Performance
- **Disk I/O and latency:**
  ```bash
  iostat -x 1
  ```
- **I/O per process (requires iotop):**
  ```bash
  iotop
  ```

---

### 5. Process-specific Performance
- **Monitor a specific process (replace PID):**
  ```bash
  pidstat -p <PID> 1
  ```
- **Trace system calls of a process:**
  ```bash
  strace -p <PID>
  ```

---

### 6. Network Performance
- **List process network usage:**
  ```bash
  netstat -tulnp
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ss -tulnp
  ```
- **Monitor bandwidth usage (requires iftop or nload):**
  ```bash
  iftop
  ```
  ```bash
  nload
  ```

---

### Summary
- Use **top/htop** for real-time process overview.  
- Use **ps** for snapshots of CPU and memory usage.  
- Use **vmstat, iostat, pidstat** for detailed monitoring.  
- Use **sar** for historical performance.

# How files stored in a UNIX system? File structure
In a **UNIX system**, files are stored using a structured model that combines **inodes, data blocks, and directories**.

---

### 1. Filesystem Structure
A UNIX filesystem is divided into:
- **Boot block** ‚Üí Boot information (used for system startup).
- **Superblock** ‚Üí Metadata about the filesystem (size, free blocks, free inodes).
- **Inode table** ‚Üí Stores metadata about files.
- **Data blocks** ‚Üí Actual file content.
- **Directories** ‚Üí Special files that map filenames to inode numbers.

---

### 2. Inodes (Index Nodes)
Each file has an **inode**, which contains:
- File type (regular file, directory, symlink, etc.)
- Permissions (read/write/execute)
- Owner and group
- File size
- Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)
- **Pointers to data blocks** (where the actual file data is stored on disk)

üëâ **Inodes do not store the filename**, only metadata + pointers.  
Filenames are stored in directories, which map **filename ‚Üí inode number**.

---

### 3. Data Blocks
The actual file content (text, binary, etc.) is stored in **blocks** on disk.  
- Small files fit into a few blocks.  
- Large files may need **direct, indirect, double-indirect, and triple-indirect pointers** from the inode to reach all their blocks.  

---

### 4. Directories
Directories are just **special files** that contain entries:
`filename ‚Üí inode number`

When you `ls -l`, the system looks up filenames in the directory, finds the inode number, then uses the inode to fetch metadata and locate data blocks.

---

### 5. File Access Flow
When you open a file:
1. The system finds the **directory entry** ‚Üí gets the inode number.
2. Reads the **inode** ‚Üí finds metadata + block pointers.
3. Fetches **data blocks** ‚Üí gives you file contents.

---

### 6. Example
Suppose you create a file `hello.txt`:
1. A new inode is allocated (say inode #1234).
2. The filename `hello.txt` is stored in the directory, pointing to inode #1234.
3. The file‚Äôs content ("Hello World") is stored in data blocks.
4. Inode #1234 keeps pointers to those blocks and metadata.

---

### 7. ASCII Diagram

```
Directory Entry
+---------------------+
|  hello.txt -> 1234  |  (Filename maps to inode number)
+---------------------+

Inode #1234 (Metadata + Pointers)
+------------------------------------------+
| Permissions: rw-r--r--                   |
| Owner: user                              |
| Size: 11 bytes                           |
| Timestamps: created, modified, accessed  |
| Data Block Pointers: [200, 201]          |
+------------------------------------------+

Data Blocks
+-------------+     +-------------+
| Block 200   |     | Block 201   |
| "Hello "    |     | "World"     |
+-------------+     +-------------+
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary
In UNIX, files are stored as **inodes + data blocks**, where:
- **Inode = metadata + pointers**
- **Data blocks = file content**
- **Directories = mapping of filenames to inodes**

# Suppose you are moving a file from one server to client and file transfer speed is very slow. How will you troubleshoot for the same?

#### 1. Check the File Transfer Method
- Identify how the file is being moved: scp, rsync, sftp, NFS mount, HTTP, FTP, etc.
- **Some tools/protocols add overhead** (e.g., encryption in scp/sftp). For testing, try a lighter protocol (e.g., rsync --inplace --whole-file or plain nc).
#### 2. Check Network Performance
- Use ping to check latency: `ping <server_ip>`
- Use `traceroute` or `mtr` to detect hops causing delay.
- Measure raw network bandwidth with tools like `iperf3`:
    - `iperf3 -s   # On server`
    - `iperf3 -c <server_ip>   # On client`
- Look for packet loss or very high latency.
#### 3. Check Server and Client Resources
- CPU and memory usage (e.g., `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`).
- Disk I/O bottlenecks: `iostat -x 1`
- Network interface utilization: `ifstat` `sar -n DEV 1`
#### 4. Ensure NIC isn‚Äôt stuck at 100 Mbps instead of 1 Gbps/10 Gbps: 
-  `ethtool eth0`
#### 5. Check File Size and Disk Throughput
- If file is very large, the disk‚Äôs read/write speed can be a bottleneck.
- Test raw disk performance with `dd` or `fio`:
    - `dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1G count=1 oflag=direct`
#### 6. Check Protocol-Level Bottlenecks
- For SSH-based transfers, encryption can slow things down:
    - Try weaker cipher for testing:  `scp -c aes128-ctr file user@host:/path/`
- For NFS, check mount options (`rsize`, `wsize`, `tcp/udp`).
- For HTTP/FTP, confirm server process limits (connection limits, throttling).
#### 7. Tune protocol/TCP buffers and settings

# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

#### 1. What is DHCP?
- DHCP is a network protocol used to **automatically assign IP addresses** and other network configuration parameters (subnet mask, gateway, DNS) to devices on a network.
- Eliminates the need for manual IP configuration on each device.
- Works in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

---

#### 2. How DHCP Works (Basic Flow)
1. **DHCPDISCOVER** ‚Üí Client broadcasts to discover DHCP servers.  
2. **DHCPOFFER** ‚Üí Server responds with an available IP address and configuration.  
3. **DHCPREQUEST** ‚Üí Client requests the offered IP address.  
4. **DHCPACK** ‚Üí Server acknowledges and assigns the IP address to the client.

---

#### 3. Components of DHCP
- **DHCP Server** ‚Üí Manages IP address pool and leases.  
- **DHCP Client** ‚Üí Device requesting IP configuration.  
- **DHCP Relay** ‚Üí Forwards DHCP requests across different subnets.  

---

#### 4. DHCP Lease
- IP address assignment is temporary; client must renew before lease expires.  
- Lease duration can be configured on the DHCP server.

---

#### 5. Common DHCP Commands (Linux)
- **View current IP info (DHCP assigned):**`ip addr show`

#### 6. Release IP (Linux):
- `sudo dhclient -r`

#### 7. Renew IP (Linux): 
- `sudo dhclient`

#### 8. Check DHCP leases: 
- `cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases`

# What is the difference between symlink and hardlink? Explain with inodes?

### 1. Hard Link
- A hard link is another name (alias) for the same file on disk.
- Both the original file and hard link point to the same inode.
- Inode: Stores metadata (permissions, owner, timestamps) and pointers to the data blocks.
- Effect: Both names are equal; deleting one does not delete the data until all hard links are removed

    **Command**: `ln file.txt hardlink.txt`

### 2. Symbolic Link (Symlink)
- A symlink is a special file that points to the path of another file.
- It has its own inode, separate from the target file.
- Effect: Acts like a shortcut. If the target file is deleted, the symlink becomes dangling.
- Symlinks can cross filesystems and can point to directories.

    **Command**: `ln -s file.txt hardlink.txt`

# Linux/Docker Control Groups (Cgroups) 

#### 1. Definition
- **Cgroups** (Control Groups) are a Linux kernel feature that **limits, isolates, and monitors resource usage** of process groups.
- Resources managed include **CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth**.
- Cgroups are widely used in **containers** (Docker, Kubernetes) for resource management.

---

#### 2. Purpose
- Prevent a process or group of processes from consuming excessive resources.
- Ensure fair allocation of CPU, memory, and I/O among multiple processes or containers.
- Enable monitoring and accounting of resource usage.

---

#### 3. Features
1. **Resource Limiting**
   - Limit maximum CPU, memory, or disk usage for a group of processes.
2. **Prioritization**
   - Assign CPU shares to give higher priority to certain processes.
3. **Accounting**
   - Track resource usage for billing, monitoring, or debugging.
4. **Isolation**
   - Combine with namespaces to create isolated container environments.
5. **Control**
   - Dynamically adjust resources without stopping processes.

---

#### 4. Resource Controllers (Subsystems)
| Controller | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `cpu`      | Limit CPU usage or allocate CPU shares. |
| `cpuacct`  | Track CPU usage for processes. |
| `cpuset`   | Assign specific CPU cores and memory nodes. |
| `memory`   | Limit and monitor memory usage. |
| `blkio`    | Control and monitor disk I/O. |
| `devices`  | Control access to devices (block/character). |
| `net_cls`  | Classify network traffic for bandwidth control. |
| `pids`     | Limit the number of processes. |

---

#### 5. How Cgroups Work
- Processes are grouped into **hierarchies**.
- Each hierarchy is associated with one or more **controllers**.
- Kernel enforces **resource limits and usage tracking** per hierarchy.
- Commands like `cgcreate`, `cgexec`, and `cgset` manage cgroups.

---

#### 6. Example Use Case
- Docker containers use cgroups to:
  - Limit container memory: `docker run --memory="500m" ubuntu`
  - Limit CPU shares: `docker run --cpus="1.5" ubuntu`
- Prevent one container from starving others of resources.

---

#### 7. Summary
- Cgroups provide **resource control and isolation** for process groups.
- Key for **containerization**, enabling multiple workloads to share hardware safely.
- Combined with **namespaces**, they provide **full isolation and resource management**.


---
# Linux Namespaces

#### 1. What is a Namespace?
- A **namespace** is a Linux kernel feature that provides **isolation of system resources**.
- Each namespace gives processes a separate view of the resource it manages (like process IDs, network, or mount points).
- Widely used in **containers (Docker, LXC, Kubernetes)** to create lightweight isolation.

---

#### 2. Why Use Namespaces?
- Provide **process isolation** (one container cannot see another‚Äôs processes).
- Enable **multi-tenancy** on the same host.
- Allow containers to act as if they have their **own OS resources**, while sharing the same kernel.

---

#### 3. Types of Namespaces

| Namespace | Isolates | Example Usage |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **PID**   | Process IDs | Each container has its own process tree (`ps -ef` shows only its own processes). |
| **UTS**   | Hostname & domain | Containers can have different hostnames. |
| **Mount (mnt)** | Filesystem mount points | Each container can mount its own root filesystem. |
| **IPC**   | Inter-process communication | Separate message queues, semaphores, shared memory. |
| **Network (net)** | Network interfaces, IP addresses, routing | Each container can have its own IP address, routing table. |
| **User**  | User & group IDs | Root in a container is not root on the host. |
| **Cgroup**| Resource management | Isolates CPU, memory, and I/O usage. |

---

#### 4. How Namespaces Work
- When a process is created with `clone()` or `unshare()`, it can be placed in a new namespace.
- Processes in the same namespace share that resource‚Äôs view.
- Processes in different namespaces are **invisible to each other** for that resource.

---

#### 5. Example
```bash
# Create a new UTS namespace and set hostname
unshare -u /bin/bash
hostname container1
```

# Networking Concepts: Layers 2, 3, and 4

Networking is often explained using the **OSI Model** or the simplified **TCP/IP Model**.  
Here we will focus on **Layer 2 (Data Link), Layer 3 (Network), and Layer 4 (Transport)** in detail.

---

#### üîπ Layer 2: Data Link Layer
- **Function:** Responsible for node-to-node data transfer on the same local network (LAN).
- **Key Identifiers:** **MAC Address** (Media Access Control).
- **Protocols & Technologies:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), PPP, ARP, VLAN (802.1Q).
- **Devices Working at L2:** Switches, Bridges.
- **Operations:**
  - Encapsulates packets into **frames**.
  - Adds **MAC addresses** for source & destination.
  - Provides **error detection** using CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).
  - Manages access to the physical medium (CSMA/CD in Ethernet).
- **Example:** Sending a file between two PCs connected to the same switch uses **Layer 2 communication**.

---

#### üîπ Layer 3: Network Layer
- **Function:** Responsible for end-to-end delivery of data across **different networks**.
- **Key Identifiers:** **IP Address** (IPv4 / IPv6).
- **Protocols:** IP, ICMP, ARP, OSPF, BGP, RIP, IS-IS.
- **Devices Working at L3:** Routers, Layer 3 Switches.
- **Operations:**
  - Handles **routing**: selecting the best path across multiple networks.
  - Encapsulates data into **packets**.
  - Adds **source and destination IP addresses**.
  - Can fragment packets if needed to match MTU size.
- **Example:** Sending data from a laptop in one subnet to a server in another subnet requires **Layer 3 routing**.

---

#### üîπ Layer 4: Transport Layer
- **Function:** Ensures **reliable or fast delivery of data** between applications across devices.
- **Key Identifiers:** **Port Numbers** (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH).
- **Protocols:** TCP, UDP, SCTP.
- **Operations:**
  - **Segmentation and Reassembly:** Breaks data into segments and reassembles at destination.
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
    - Reliable, connection-oriented.
    - Error detection, retransmission, flow control, congestion control.
    - Example: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
    - Unreliable, connectionless.
    - Low latency, no retransmissions.
    - Example: Video streaming, VoIP, DNS.
- **Example:** When you open a webpage:
  - TCP establishes a connection (3-way handshake).
  - Data (HTTP packets) are transferred reliably.
  - Port numbers (80, 443) ensure the data reaches the right application.

# üåê How a Packet Travels in a Network

- **Application Layer (User action)**
    - You type a URL in your browser or send a message.  
    - The application (e.g., browser) generates data and hands it to the **transport layer**.

---
- **Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)**
    - **TCP** (connection-oriented, reliable) or **UDP** (faster, connectionless) adds a **port number**.  
    - Example: HTTP ‚Üí Port 80, HTTPS ‚Üí Port 443.  
    - Creates a **segment** (TCP) or **datagram** (UDP).

---

- **Network Layer (IP)**
    - Adds **IP addresses**:
    - **Source IP** = Computer A‚Äôs IP.  
    - **Destination IP** = Computer B‚Äôs IP.  
    - Creates an **IP packet**.

---

- **Data Link Layer (Ethernet/Wi-Fi)**
    - Adds **MAC addresses**:
    - **Source MAC** = Computer A‚Äôs NIC.  
    - **Destination MAC** = Next hop (e.g., router/gateway).  
    - If the MAC is unknown ‚Üí **ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol) is used.  
    - Forms a **frame**.

---

- **Physical Layer (Transmission)**
    - Frame is converted into electrical signals, radio waves, or light pulses.  
    - Sent over copper cable, Wi-Fi, or fiber optic.

---

- **Switches (Within LAN)**
    - Switch reads the **MAC address** in the frame.  
    - Forwards it to the correct port toward the router.  
    - If unknown, it floods the frame until MAC is learned.

---

- **Router (Leaving the LAN)**
    - Router removes the data link layer info.  
    - Looks at the **destination IP**.  
    - Checks **routing table** for the next hop.  
    - Adds a new MAC address (towards next router).  
    - Sends packet on its way.

---

- **Across the Internet**
    - Packet hops across multiple routers.  
    - Each router:
    - Looks at **destination IP**.  
    - Forwards to the next router based on its routing table (using BGP, OSPF, etc.).  
    - At each hop, **MAC changes**, but **IP stays the same**.

---

- **Destination Network**
    - Packet reaches the final router (close to Computer B).  
    - Router sends packet into B‚Äôs LAN with **Computer B‚Äôs MAC address**.
---

- **Destination Machine**
    - NIC of Computer B receives the frame (MAC matches).  
    - Strips off Ethernet header.  
    - IP layer sees that the **destination IP matches** its own.  
    - Passes payload up to **transport layer**.  
    - TCP/UDP delivers data to the correct **application (via port number)**.  
    - Application (e.g., browser) processes data ‚Üí shows the webpage.

# üåç BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) - Short Notes

- **Definition**: Path-vector routing protocol (RFC 4271), runs over TCP (port 179), used to exchange routes between Autonomous Systems (AS).  

- **Types**:  
  - **eBGP** ‚Üí Between different ASes (ISP ‚Üî ISP).  
  - **iBGP** ‚Üí Within same AS (internal route sharing).  

- **Why Needed**:  
  - Connects different networks globally.  
  - Supports policies, scalability, redundancy.  
  - Enables the Internet to function as a collection of ASes.  

- **Key Attributes**:  
  - **AS-Path** ‚Üí Route history.  
  - **Next-Hop** ‚Üí Next router to reach destination.  
  - **Local Preference** ‚Üí Preferred exit.  
  - **MED** ‚Üí Entry suggestion into an AS.  
  - **Weight** ‚Üí Cisco-specific, higher is better.  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Scalable (handles >1M routes).  
  - Policy-based routing.  
  - Enables multi-homing with ISPs.  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Slow convergence.  
  - Misconfiguration can cause route leaks/hijacks.  
  - Security vulnerabilities.  

- **Security Measures**:  
  - Prefix filtering.  
  - RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure).  
  - TTL Security (GTSM).

# üìò ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

#### üîπ Definition
- ARP is a network protocol used to map an **IP address (Layer 3)** to a **MAC address (Layer 2)** in a local network.  
- Defined in **RFC 826**.  
- Works only within the same **LAN / broadcast domain**.  

---

#### üîπ Why ARP is Needed
- Devices communicate using **MAC addresses** at the **data link layer**.  
- Applications use **IP addresses** at the **network layer**.  
- **ARP provides the translation** between IP and MAC, enabling communication.  

---

#### üîπ How ARP Works
1. Device wants to send data to IP `192.168.1.10`.  
2. It checks its **ARP cache** for the MAC address.  
3. If not found ‚Üí It sends a **broadcast ARP request**:  
   - ‚ÄúWho has 192.168.1.10? Tell me.‚Äù  
4. The target device replies with its **MAC address (unicast)**.  
5. Sender stores **IP-MAC mapping** in the ARP cache for future use.  

---

#### üîπ ARP Message Types
- **ARP Request** ‚Üí Broadcast asking for the MAC of an IP.  
- **ARP Reply** ‚Üí Unicast response with the MAC address.  
- **Gratuitous ARP** ‚Üí A device announces its own IP‚ÄìMAC mapping (used for updates, IP conflict detection).  

---

#### üîπ Problems with ARP
- **ARP Spoofing / Poisoning** ‚Üí Attacker sends fake ARP replies ‚Üí traffic redirection ‚Üí Man-in-the-Middle (MITM).  
- **Broadcast Traffic Overhead** ‚Üí Too many ARP requests in large networks can affect performance.  

---


# STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
#### üîπ Definition

- STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) is a Layer 2 network protocol that prevents loops in a switched (bridged) network.
- Standard: IEEE 802.1D.
- STP ensures there is always a loop-free logical topology, even if redundant paths exist.

#### üîπ Why STP is Needed
- In a network with redundant links, loops can occur.
    ##### Loops cause:
    - Broadcast storms (infinite broadcast circulation).
    - Multiple frame copies (same frame delivered many times).
    - MAC table instability (switches keep updating MAC addresses).
    - STP blocks redundant paths while keeping one active path ‚Üí prevents loops.

 # Notes on VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
#### üîπ Definition
- VLAN (Virtual LAN) is a logical subdivision of a physical network.
- It allows devices to be grouped into separate networks even if they are connected to the same - physical switch.
- Standard: IEEE 802.1Q (uses **VLAN tagging**).

#### üîπ Why VLAN is Needed
- Segmentation ‚Äì divides a large LAN into smaller, manageable networks.
- Security ‚Äì isolates sensitive departments (e.g., HR vs. Finance).
- Reduced Broadcast Domain ‚Äì limits broadcast traffic only within a VLAN.
- Performance ‚Äì reduces unnecessary traffic, improving efficiency.
- Flexibility ‚Äì group devices logically, not based on physical location.
- Scalability ‚Äì supports large enterprise networks.

#### üîπ VLAN Components
- Access Port: Connects to end devices (PCs, printers). Belongs to one VLAN.
- Trunk Port: Carries multiple VLANs between switches using VLAN tags.
- VLAN Tagging: Process of marking Ethernet frames with VLAN IDs (802.1Q).
- Inter-VLAN Routing: Required for communication between different VLANs (done by router or Layer 3 switch).

# ‚úÖ Test Cases for SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)

SCP is used to securely transfer files between hosts over SSH.  
Test cases cover **functionality, security, performance, and error handling**.

---

#### 1. Basic File Transfer
- **TC1:** Copy a small file from local to remote host.  
- **TC2:** Copy a file from remote host to local.  
- **TC3:** Copy a file between two remote hosts (using local as jump).  

---

#### 2. Directory Transfer
- **TC4:** Copy an entire directory recursively with `-r`.  
- **TC5:** Copy hidden files and directories.  

---

#### 3. File Integrity
- **TC6:** Verify checksum (e.g., `md5sum`) of source and destination file matches.  
- **TC7:** Copy large file (GBs) and confirm no corruption.  

---

#### 4. Authentication
- **TC8:** SCP with password-based authentication.  
- **TC9:** SCP with SSH key-based authentication.  
- **TC10:** SCP with invalid credentials ‚Üí should fail.  

---

#### 5. Permissions & Ownership
- **TC11:** Copy file as normal user to a location requiring root ‚Üí should fail.  
- **TC12:** Preserve timestamps and permissions using `-p`.  
- **TC13:** Transfer with `sudo scp` to restricted directories.  

---

#### 6. Error Handling
- **TC14:** Copy a non-existent file ‚Üí should show error.  
- **TC15:** Destination path invalid ‚Üí should show error.  
- **TC16:** Network disconnect during transfer ‚Üí should fail gracefully.  

---

#### 7. Security
- **TC17:** Verify SCP uses SSH encryption (check with `tcpdump` or logs).  
- **TC18:** Ensure no plaintext password exposure.  
- **TC19:** Test SCP with strict host key checking (`-o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`).  

---

#### 8. Performance
- **TC20:** Measure transfer speed for different file sizes.  
- **TC21:** Compare performance with and without compression (`-C`).  
- **TC22:** Parallel transfers from multiple clients.  

---

#### 9. Compatibility
- **TC23:** SCP between different OS (Linux ‚Üî Windows, Linux ‚Üî macOS).  
- **TC24:** SCP with different SSH versions.  

---

#### 10. Edge Cases
- **TC25:** Copy zero-byte file.  
- **TC26:** Copy file with special characters in filename.  
- **TC27:** Copy very large directory with thousands of files.  
- **TC28:** Copy file with very long path names.


# How a clustered system works.
#### How it works:
- Multiple Nodes ‚Äì Two or more machines are connected through a high-speed network.
- Shared Workload ‚Äì Tasks are distributed among nodes (load balancing).
- Shared Storage/State ‚Äì Nodes may access the same database or file system to stay consistent.
- Failover Mechanism ‚Äì If one node fails, another takes over its workload (high availability).
- Cluster Management Software ‚Äì Coordinates communication, monitors health, and ensures transparent operation to end users.
#### Reasons for Needing a Cluster
- High Availability (HA):
    - If one server fails, another takes over (failover).
    - Ensures minimal downtime for critical applications.
- Scalability:
    - Add more nodes to handle growing workloads.
    - Supports more users, data, or traffic without replacing hardware.
- Performance:
    - Workload is distributed across multiple servers.
    - Improves speed and response time (parallel processing).
- Fault Tolerance:
    - No single point of failure.
    - Cluster keeps running even if one or more nodes fail.
- Cost Efficiency:
    - Use multiple inexpensive servers instead of one high-end, costly machine.
#### Common Use Cases
- Web Hosting: Distributing web traffic across multiple servers.
- Databases: Replicating data across nodes for reliability.
- High-Performance Computing (HPC): Running complex computations in parallel.
#### Example Cluster Types
- Load-Balancing Clusters: Distribute incoming requests (e.g., web servers).
- High-Availability Clusters: Ensure service continuity (e.g., database clusters).
#### Interview Questions
1. What is a clustered system and why is it used?
    - A clustered system is a group of interconnected computers that work together as a single system to provide high availability, scalability, and performance. It is used to ensure continuous service, handle increased workloads, and improve fault tolerance.
2. How does failover work in a clustered environment?
    - When a node fails, the cluster management software detects it and redirects the workload to another healthy node.
3. What are the differences between a clustered system and a distributed system?
   - A clustered system is a group of interconnected computers that work together as a single system, while a distributed system is a network of independent computers that communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.

# What are the parameters of IOSTAT in Linux?
- Parameters include: 
```
  -c (CPU statistics) - shows CPU usage statistics.
  -d (device statistics) - shows I/O statistics for each device.
  -x (extended device statistics) - shows detailed statistics like utilization and average wait time.
    -k (display in kilobytes) - shows statistics in KB instead of blocks.
    -m (display in megabytes) - shows statistics in MB.
    -p (display for specific devices) - shows statistics for specified devices only.
    -t (timestamp) - adds a timestamp to each line of output.
    -N (no headers) - suppresses the header line in the output.
    -h (human-readable) - shows sizes in human-readable format (e.g., 1K, 234M, 2G).
    -r (reset counters) - resets all I/O statistics counters.
```
# How do you find the gateway in Linux?
- You can find the gateway in Linux using commands like 'ip route' or 'route -n'.
- Use 'ip route' command: This displays the routing table, including the default gateway.

    **Example:** 'ip route show' will show output like 'default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0'.
- Use 'route -n': This command also shows the routing table with the gateway information.

    **Example:** 'route -n' will display a table with 'UG' flag indicating the default gateway.

---
# How does DNS work?
- DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses for web access.
- DNS stands for Domain Name System, functioning like a phonebook for the internet.
- When you enter a URL, a DNS query is sent to resolve the domain name.
- The DNS resolver checks its cache; if not found, it queries DNS servers.
- Root DNS servers direct the query to TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers, e.g., .com.
- TLD servers point to authoritative DNS servers for the specific domain.
- Authoritative servers return the IP address, allowing the browser to connect.

----------

# Why is NAT needed?
- NAT is needed to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.
- NAT helps conserve public IP addresses by allowing multiple devices on a private network to communicate with the internet using a single public IP address.
- Internet Access for Private Resources
    - Allows servers in private subnets (like databases, backend apps) to download patches, updates, or reach external APIs.
- Security
    - Blocks incoming traffic from the internet (since private IPs are not directly exposed).
- IP Address Conservation
    - Multiple private instances can share a single public IP through NAT.
- Use in Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
    - In AWS, a NAT Gateway is a managed service for outbound internet access from private subnets.

    **Examples**: NAT is commonly used in home networks to allow multiple devices to access the internet through a single public IP address provided by the ISP.

‚úÖ **Summary Approach:**  
- Cover **functional, boundary, security, performance, usability, integration, and recovery** scenarios.  
- Include **positive and negative tests**.  
- Prioritize **critical flows like upload, download, sharing, and permissions**.


# How do you handle REST APIs, authentication, and security testing?
#### 1.  Authentication
- Verify the identity of users or clients accessing your API.

Methods:
- API Keys ‚Üí Simple key for each client.
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT ‚Üí Token-based, stateless, scalable.
- Basic Auth over HTTPS ‚Üí Username/password for simple scenarios.
Ensure tokens/keys are short-lived and revocable.       

#### 2.  Authorization
- Ensure users can only access allowed resources.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- Assign roles (admin, user, guest) and enforce - permissions per endpoint.
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):
- Fine-grained access based on user attributes, resource, and action.

#### 3.  Input Validation
- Validate all inputs (query params, JSON payloads).
- Prevent injection attacks:
  - SQL/NoSQL injection
  - Command injection
- Reject unexpected/malformed requests.

#### 4. Data Protection
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (database encryption).
- Avoid exposing sensitive info in responses (passwords, keys, internal IDs).

#### 5. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
- Limit number of requests per client/IP per time window.
Example: 1000 requests/hour per API key.

#### 6. Security Headers
- Implement HTTP security headers:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security

# Can you explain the basics of file systems?
#### 1. Key Components of a File System

- **Files:** Basic units of storage containing data or programs.  
- **Directories (Folders):** Containers for organizing files hierarchically.  
- **Metadata:** Information about a file, such as size, type, creation date, and permissions.  
- **Inodes (in Unix/Linux):** Data structure storing metadata and pointers to file blocks.  
- **Data Blocks:** Actual blocks on the disk where the file‚Äôs content is stored.  
- **File Allocation Table (FAT) or Journals:** Tracks which blocks are used/free.  

---

#### 2. Types of File Systems

#### FAT (File Allocation Table)
- Simple, used in older Windows systems and USB drives.  
- Versions: **FAT12, FAT16, FAT32**  

#### NTFS (New Technology File System)
- Used in modern Windows systems.  
- Supports permissions, encryption, large files, journaling.  

#### ext (Extended File System)
- Linux/Unix systems.  
- Versions: **ext2** (no journaling), **ext3** (journaling), **ext4** (modern)  

#### HFS+ / APFS
- Used in macOS.  
- APFS is optimized for SSDs, snapshots, and encryption.  

#### Network File Systems
- Examples: **NFS, SMB/CIFS**  
- Allow file sharing over a network.  

---

#### 3. File System Operations

- Create/Delete files or directories  
- Read/Write file data  
- Rename or move files  
- Set permissions  
- Search and list directory contents
- Mount/Unmount file systems

---
#### 4. Data Blocks
- Data blocks are the **actual units of storage** on the disk.  
- Every file‚Äôs content is stored in **one or more data blocks**.  
- Fixed size (e.g., 4 KB per block in ext4).  
- The OS needs a way to know **which blocks belong to which file**.

---

#### 5. Inodes (used in Unix/Linux file systems)
- **Inode** = Index Node, a data structure that stores **metadata of a file**:
  - File type, permissions, owner, timestamps  
  - File size  
  - Pointers to the **data blocks** of the file
- **Key point:** The inode **does NOT store the file name**; names are stored in the directory entry.  
- Inode numbers are unique within a file system.
- Inodes are typically stored in a fixed-size table on the disk.
- Fixed number of inodes created when the file system is formatted.
- If all inodes are used, no new files can be created even if there is free space.

#### How it works:
- Directory maps **filename ‚Üí inode number**  
- Inode maps **inode number ‚Üí data blocks**

**Example:**
- File: report.txt
- Directory entry: report.txt ‚Üí inode 101
- Inode 101 ‚Üí points to data blocks: 500, 501, 502

#### 6. FAT (File Allocation Table, used in FAT file systems)
- FAT is a table that tracks which blocks are used by which file.
- Each file has a starting block. FAT table links all blocks of the file like a chain.
- Unlike inodes, FAT stores block mapping in one centralized table.
- Useful for small/simple file systems like USB drives.

Example:
- File starts at block 500
- FAT[500] ‚Üí 501
- FAT[501] ‚Üí 502
- FAT[502] ‚Üí -1 (end of file)

# Debugging: NodeA ‚Üí NodeB works, NodeB ‚Üí NodeA fails

## Connectivity Tools
- `ping`, `traceroute` from both sides to check packet flow.  
- Use `tcpdump`/`wireshark` on NodeA to see if ICMP packets arrive.  

## Firewall / Security Rules
- Check `iptables`, `ufw`, `firewalld` on NodeA.  
- In cloud: verify **security groups / network ACLs** allow inbound ICMP.  

## IP & Interface Config
- `ip addr show` ‚Üí confirm correct IP & subnet mask.  
- `ip route show` ‚Üí verify valid routes back to NodeB.  

## Routing Issues
- Ensure **default gateway** is correct.  
- Check intermediate routers for asymmetric routes.  

## NAT / Load Balancer
- If NAT is in path, confirm **return translation** exists.  
- Load balancers may allow **one-way health check traffic only**.  
    NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method used by routers/firewalls to translate private IP addresses into public IP addresses (and vice versa).
    It allows devices in a private network (like your home Wi-Fi) to access the internet using a single public IP.

## ARP / Layer 2 Issues
- On NodeB: run `arp -n` for NodeA‚Äôs entry.  
- On NodeA: confirm ARP requests reach (`tcpdump arp`).  
- Check VLAN / port-security misconfig that could drop replies.  
    ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local network (LAN).
    IP address = Logical address (used for routing at Layer 3).
    MAC address = Physical address (used for actual delivery at Layer 2).
    Since devices need the MAC address to send packets inside a LAN, ARP helps them resolve ‚ÄúWho has this IP? Tell me your MAC.‚Äù

## Resource / OS Issues
- ICMP disabled on NodeA OS.  
- Network interface down or NIC bonding misconfigured.  

## Cloud / Infra Policies
- Cloud provider security policies blocking inbound ICMP.

## Packet Capture
- Capture on NodeA: `tcpdump -i <interface> icmp` to see if packets arrive.

# Firewalls
1. Packet Filtering Firewall
    - Inspects packets and allows or denies them based on predefined rules.
    - Operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
    - Commonly used in routers and switches.
    - Simple and fast, but lacks deep inspection capabilities.
    - Checks source/destination IP, port, protocol
2. Stateful Inspection Firewall
    - Monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.
    - Operates at multiple layers (Layer 3 and Layer 4) of the OSI model.
    - More secure than packet filtering as it tracks connection states.
    - Can block unsolicited incoming traffic while allowing responses to outgoing requests.
3. Application/Proxy Firewall
    - Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
    - Inspects the content of the traffic, not just headers.
    - Can filter traffic based on specific applications or services (e.g., HTTP, FTP). HTTP/HTTPS filtering
    - Provides more granular control and can block specific types of content.
    - Often used in conjunction with other firewall types for enhanced security.
4. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
    - Combines traditional firewall capabilities with advanced features like intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and application awareness.
    - Can identify and block sophisticated threats by analyzing traffic patterns and behaviors.
    - Often includes features like SSL/TLS inspection, antivirus, and anti-malware.
    - Provides comprehensive security for modern networks.
5. Software Firewall
    - Installed on individual devices (e.g., PCs, servers) to monitor and control incoming/outgoing traffic.
    - Can be more easily customized and updated than hardware firewalls.
    - Often includes features like application control, intrusion detection, and VPN support.
6. Hardware Firewall
    - Dedicated physical devices that provide firewall functionality.
    - Typically placed at the network perimeter to protect internal networks from external threats.
    - Can handle high traffic volumes and provide robust security features.
    - Often used in enterprise environments for comprehensive network protection.
7. Cloud Firewall   
    - Firewall services provided by cloud providers to protect cloud-based resources.
    - Can be configured to control traffic to and from cloud instances, applications, and services.
    - Often includes features like DDoS protection, web application firewall (WAF), and traffic monitoring.
    - Scalable and flexible to meet the needs of dynamic cloud environments.
