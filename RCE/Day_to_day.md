Below is a **strong IC5-level answer** describing *“What your day looks like as an IC5”* — combining **technical depth, leadership, architecture influence, cross-team collaboration, roadmap ownership, operational excellence, and mentoring**.

This answer positions you as a **senior individual contributor who drives direction, not just tasks** — exactly what interviewers expect for IC5.

# ⭐ **What My Day Looks Like as an IC5 Engineer**

As an IC5, my day is a balance of **deep technical work, architecture decisions, cross-team alignment, operational ownership, and mentoring**.
Unlike mid-level engineers, I’m responsible not just for delivering features, but for **guiding the technical direction** and ensuring the **long-term health** of the services I own.

---

# ⭐ **1. Start of the Day — Operational Check & Observability Review (30–45 mins)**

I begin by reviewing the **operational health** of our service (RCE):

* Check dashboards: error rate, latency, workflow success rate
* Review SLO burn rate and ensure we’re within error budget
* Check overnight deployments or canary rollouts
* Respond to any SRE/alerts/slack notifications
* Validate any upgrade waves launched overnight (if applicable)

If anything looks off, I immediately prioritize **containment + RCA** before diving into planned work.

---

# ⭐ **2. Deep Work / Architecture Design (2–3 hours)**

I block time each day for **focused technical design**, which may include:

* Designing new workflow orchestration patterns for SDDC upgrades
* Improving state machines, idempotency, consistency, and drift detection
* Evaluating new architectural proposals (service decomposition, async workflows, event-driven patterns)
* Reviewing capacity planning, SDDC upgrade velocity, or scale targets
* Working on strategic initiatives like performance improvements, EKS migration, or resilience gaps

At IC5 level, this deep technical contribution is key — I’m often the primary architect of multi-service workflows.

---

# ⭐ **3. Code & Implementation (1–2 hours)**

I still contribute hands-on code:

* Implement critical modules
* Clean up technical debt that blocks progress
* Build internal tooling to automate workflows
* Develop reliability or reconciliation logic
* Review performance bottlenecks or optimize DB queries
* Write production-ready code with extensive tests

IC5s don’t code the most — but we code the **most critical** and **most impactful** parts.

---

# ⭐ **4. Mentoring, Reviews & Technical Guidance (1–2 hours)**

I’m deeply involved in **technical reviews**:

* Reviewing design docs from IC3/IC4 engineers
* Providing architectural mentorship
* Reviewing PRs with focus on scalability, reliability, and code clarity
* Coaching engineers on system design, Kubernetes patterns, and best practices
* Ensuring our team builds **long-term maintainable systems**, not short-term hacks

I help raise the overall technical bar of my team.

---

# ⭐ **5. Cross-Team Collaboration & Alignment (1–2 hours)**

A significant part of my role is working across teams, such as:

* RLCM team
* Host-Management team
* BRS (Backup/Restore)
* SRE and Platform teams
* Program and Release management
* Security/IAM teams
* AWS partners (EKS, EC2, S3 integration issues)

Typical activities:

* Aligning workflows across multiple services
* Ensuring backward compatibility before others upgrade
* Driving technical decisions that impact the broader ecosystem
* Planning phased rollouts and migration strategies
* Ensuring everyone understands reliability guard rails

This cross-team influence is a key responsibility at IC5.

---

# ⭐ **6. Roadmap, Strategy & Planning (30–60 mins)**

I partner with PMs and engineering managers to:

* Define roadmap for scaling RCE workflows
* Prioritize reliability work vs. feature work
* Identify long-term architectural risks
* Plan tech debt removal
* Shape EKS upgrade strategies, rollout waves, and automation improvements
* Influence SDDC lifecycle roadmap

I’m expected to think 6–12 months ahead, not just about the next sprint.

---

# ⭐ **7. Production Support & Incident Leadership (Varies)**

If a production issue arises:

* I take leadership in **triage, diagnosis, and mitigation**
* Coordinate with SRE + multiple teams
* Drive decisions during incident bridge calls
* Communicate clearly with stakeholders and managers
* Ensure we stay within SLO/error budgets
* Drive post-incident improvements and design changes

IC5s often act as **incident commanders** for complex multi-team failures.

---

# ⭐ **8. End of Day — Communication & Documentation (30 mins)**

I wrap up by:

* Documenting design decisions
* Updating confluence pages or ADRs
* Sharing progress updates with EM/PM
* Unblocking engineers by reviewing open PRs
* Preparing for next day’s deep work blocks

This ensures the team is aligned and no one is blocked.

---

# ⭐ **In Summary — My IC5 Role Looks Like This**

A typical day is a mix of:

* **40% Technical Architecture & Deep Work**
* **20% Implementation / Coding**
* **20% Cross-Team Coordination & Leadership**
* **10% Mentoring / Design Reviews**
* **10% Operational Monitoring & Incident Handling**

As an IC5, my responsibility is to ensure the service is:

* **Reliable** (meets 99.95% uptime)
* **Scalable**
* **Secure and compliant**
* **Easy for others to develop and maintain**
* **Aligned with broader platform direction**

And ultimately, to deliver **long-term impact**, not just short-term features.
