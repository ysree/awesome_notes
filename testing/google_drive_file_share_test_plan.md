## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Product Overview
Google Drive is a cloud-based file storage and synchronization service that allows users to store, share, and collaborate on files (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, videos) across devices. Key features include:
- File upload/download/sync across web, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop apps.
- Real-time collaboration (e.g., Google Docs).
- Sharing with permissions (view, edit, comment).
- Search, versioning, and offline access.
- Integration with Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, etc.).
- Storage quotas (15 GB free, paid plans up to 30 TB).

This test plan focuses on **system-level testing** to validate end-to-end functionality, integration, performance, security, and usability under real-world conditions.

### 1.2 Test Objectives
- Verify core workflows: upload, download, sync, share, and collaborate.
- Ensure scalability for concurrent users and large files.
- Validate cross-platform compatibility and error handling.
- Identify performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and usability issues.
- Achieve 95% test coverage for critical paths.

### 1.3 Scope
**In Scope:**
- End-to-end system testing: Web, mobile apps, desktop sync client.
- Functional: File operations, sharing, collaboration.
- Non-Functional: Performance (load, stress), security (auth, encryption), usability (UI/UX).
- Integration: With Google Workspace apps, third-party integrations (e.g., Slack).

**Out of Scope:**
- Unit/integration testing of individual components.
- Hardware-specific testing (e.g., specific device models).
- Long-term data retention testing beyond 30 days.

### 1.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Access to Google Drive accounts (free/paid tiers) and test data.
- Stable test environments (browsers: Chrome/Edge/Firefox; OS: Windows/macOS/Android/iOS).
- Dependencies: Google Workspace APIs, network stability for WAN simulations.
- Tools: Selenium for automation, JMeter for load testing, Postman for API validation.

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Functional Testing
- **Approach:** Black-box testing using manual and automated scripts (Selenium/PyTest).
- **Coverage:** 100% for core features (upload/download/share/sync).
- **Techniques:** Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance:** Load testing with 1,000 concurrent users uploading 1 GB files.
- **Security:** OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning; test for SQL injection, XSS.
- **Usability:** User acceptance testing (UAT) with 20 beta users.

### 2.3 Test Types
- **Smoke Testing:** Basic functionality (login, upload small file).
- **Sanity Testing:** Post-fix verification.
- **Regression Testing:** Automated suite after changes.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Ad-hoc scenarios for edge cases.

## 3. Test Environment
- **Hardware:** Standard laptops/desktops (i5+, 8 GB RAM) for clients; cloud VMs for simulation.
- **Software:**
  - Browsers: Latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
  - Mobile: Android 12+ (Samsung Galaxy), iOS 16+ (iPhone 13).
  - Desktop: Windows 11, macOS Ventura.
- **Network:** Simulated WAN (50-500 ms latency) using tc/netem.
- **Accounts:** 50 test accounts (personal, shared drives); 100 GB test data (files: 1 KB to 4 GB).
- **Tools:** Selenium WebDriver, Appium (mobile), JMeter, BrowserStack (cross-device).
