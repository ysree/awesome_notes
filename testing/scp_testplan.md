# ✅ Test Cases for SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)

SCP is used to securely transfer files between hosts over SSH.  
Test cases cover **functionality, security, performance, and error handling**.


# Test Plan – Secure Copy (SCP) for Distributed File Transfer

**Date:** October 01, 2025  
**Author:** Grok (xAI)

This test plan outlines a comprehensive strategy for validating a Secure Copy (SCP) implementation used for secure file transfers in a distributed file browsing and download system. SCP, built on SSH, ensures encrypted, reliable file transfers between nodes or clients across distributed environments (e.g., cloud-based systems like AWS S3 with SSH access or on-premises clusters). The plan focuses on functional correctness (e.g., file integrity), performance (e.g., transfer speed), security (e.g., encryption, authentication), fault tolerance (e.g., network interruptions), and automation for CI/CD integration. It draws from best practices in distributed systems and security testing, emphasizing resilience and compliance with standards like NIST 800-53 for secure data transfer.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This test plan defines the methodology for testing an SCP-based file transfer system within a distributed environment to verify:
- **Data Integrity**: Files transferred via SCP retain their content and metadata without corruption.
- **Performance**: Achieve high transfer speeds (e.g., >100MB/s) and low latency under varying loads.
- **Security**: Ensure encryption (e.g., AES-256), authentication (e.g., key-based), and protection against attacks (e.g., MITM).
- **Reliability**: Handle network interruptions, partial transfers, and node failures with resumable transfers.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to security standards (e.g., NIST 800-53) for secure data transfer.

Automation targets 85%+ coverage to enable rapid regression testing in CI/CD pipelines, reducing manual effort and ensuring robustness.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Functional testing of SCP file transfers (upload/download, integrity, resumes).
  - Performance testing under load (e.g., concurrent transfers).
  - Security testing (authentication, encryption, vulnerabilities).
  - Resilience testing (network failures, node crashes).
  - Integration with distributed systems (e.g., SSH server on storage nodes).
  - Automation for functional, performance, and security tests.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Hardware-specific testing (e.g., NIC performance).
  - Full compliance audits (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA; separate plans).
  - Client-side UI testing (focus on SCP protocol and server-side).

### 1.3 References
- NIST 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems.
- OpenSSH Documentation: SCP Protocol Specifications.
- OWASP Testing Guide: Secure File Transfer Testing.
- Tools: Testcontainers, JMeter, OWASP ZAP.

## 2. Objectives
- Achieve 95%+ automation coverage for functional and regression tests.
- Validate file integrity in 100% of transfer scenarios.
- Ensure system supports 1,000+ concurrent transfers with <5% error rate.
- Detect regressions in <5 minutes via CI pipelines.
- Verify security controls (e.g., encryption, authentication) in all critical paths.
- Generate reports with metrics (e.g., transfer speed, error rates, recovery time).

## 3. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Access to SSH-enabled test clusters (e.g., Dockerized OpenSSH servers).
- Synthetic file generators for test data (e.g., 1GB+ files).
- CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for test execution.
- Team familiarity with SSH/SCP protocols and Python for automation.
- Availability of mock network environments for failure simulation.

## 4. Test Strategy

### 4.1 Approach
Adopt a layered, security-focused strategy:
1. **Functional Testing**: Validate SCP transfers (upload/download, resume) with diverse file types/sizes.
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure throughput and latency under load (e.g., concurrent users, large files).
3. **Security Testing**: Verify encryption, authentication, and resistance to attacks (e.g., injection, interception).
4. **Resilience Testing**: Inject faults (e.g., network drops, node failures) to ensure recovery.
5. **Property-Based Testing**: Use random inputs (e.g., Hypothesis) to assert invariants like integrity.
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate tests to run on commits; fail builds on critical errors.

### 4.2 Test Levels
| Level | Description | Focus | Automation % |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Unit | SCP client/server functions (e.g., file transfer logic). | Code logic, edge cases. | 100% |
| Integration | SCP interactions with SSH server and storage. | Protocol, authentication. | 90% |
| End-to-End (E2E) | Full transfer flows (client → server → storage). | Integrity, usability. | 80% |
| Performance | Load and stress testing. | Throughput, latency. | 70% |
| Security | Authentication, encryption, vulnerabilities. | Compliance, attacks. | 85% |
| Resilience | Fault injection (e.g., network, node). | Recovery, consistency. | 75% |

### 4.3 Automation Framework
- **Languages/Tools**: Python (Pytest) for functional tests; Bash for SCP commands; Go (for SSH client testing if needed).
- **Orchestration**: Testcontainers for ephemeral SSH servers; Kubernetes for distributed setups.
- **Assertions**: Checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for integrity; timeouts for latency; OWASP ZAP for security.
- **CI/CD**: Parallel test execution; fail builds on >1% error rate or security violations.
- **Reporting**: Allure for dashboards; Prometheus for metrics; ELK for logs.

## 5. Tools and Environment
| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Testing Framework | Pytest, GoTest | Functional and unit testing. |
| Simulation | Testcontainers, Docker Compose | Ephemeral SSH servers and clusters. |
| Load Testing | JMeter, Locust | Simulate concurrent transfers. |
| Security Testing | OWASP ZAP, OpenSSL | Vulnerability scans, encryption checks. |
| Chaos Testing | Chaos Toolkit, Gremlin | Fault injection (network, node). |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana | Metrics (e.g., transfer speed, errors). |
| Environment | Docker, Kubernetes | Isolated test setups. |

- **Environment**: Local Docker for development; Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) for staging; mock network layers for latency/packet loss.
- **Data**: Synthetic files (e.g., `dd` for 1MB-10GB files); varied types (text, binary, compressed).
