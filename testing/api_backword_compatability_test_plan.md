# Test Plan – vCenter REST APIs

## 1. Objective
- Validate the correctness, reliability, and performance of vCenter REST APIs.
- Ensure functional coverage for VM management, cluster operations, networking, storage, and authentication.
- Maintain backward compatibility and proper integration with vCenter clients and automation workflows.

## 2. Scope
- **In-Scope:**
  - Functional validation of CRUD operations for VMs, hosts, clusters, datastores, and networks.
  - API contract testing (request/response schemas).
  - Authentication and RBAC enforcement.
  - Performance and scalability tests (provisioning, power operations at scale).
  - Integration with automation frameworks (SDKs, Ansible, Terraform).
- **Out-of-Scope:**
  - GUI-specific tests (covered in UI test plans).
  - Non-vCenter dependent workflows.

## 3. Test Strategy
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Validate each REST endpoint with positive and negative test cases.
  - Include boundary value analysis for inputs such as VM names, CPU/memory values, datastore capacity.
- **Contract Testing:**
  - Validate request/response structures using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.
  - Ensure mandatory and optional fields are correctly enforced.
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Run previous API version regression tests against the new API release.
  - Ensure existing clients continue to function without changes.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Validate API calls with dependent vCenter services like DRS, HA, vMotion, and storage policies.
  - Test multi-step workflows (e.g., VM provisioning → power-on → migrate → snapshot).
- **Performance & Scalability Testing:**
  - Measure throughput, latency, and error rates at large scale (thousands of VMs, hosts, and clusters).
  - Compare metrics with baseline benchmarks from previous releases.
- **Resiliency & Chaos Testing:**
  - Simulate failures like network partition, host failure, or service restarts.
  - Validate API behavior and error handling under failures.
- **Security Testing:**
  - Validate authentication (SAML, OAuth, JWT tokens) and RBAC policies.
  - Test access restrictions and audit logging.

## 4. Test Environment & Data
- Multi-cluster vCenter setup with heterogeneous ESXi hosts.
- Test namespaces or tenants for isolation.
- Automated environment provisioning using Ansible/Terraform.
- Sample VM templates, datastores, and network configurations to simulate real-world scenarios.

## 5. Automation Approach
- **Framework:** REST Assured / Postman / Karate / Python Requests / Java SDK.
- **Regression Suite:** Maintain automated tests for all REST APIs, including backward compatibility checks.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Execute automated tests in Jenkins/GitHub Actions pipelines with nightly builds.
- **Data-Driven Tests:** Reuse datasets for multiple VM types, clusters, and storage configurations.

## 6. Reporting & Communication
- **Daily Status:** Shared in stand-ups with dev and QA teams.
- **Automated Reports:** Published to dashboards (Allure, ExtentReports, Grafana).
- **Weekly Sync:** Review test progress, risks, and blockers with PM, QA, and Dev teams.

## 7. Entry & Exit Criteria
- **Entry:**
  - vCenter REST APIs deployed in test/staging environment.
  - Test data and automation framework ready.
  - API specification reviewed and approved.
- **Exit:**
  - All functional, backward compatibility, and performance test cases executed successfully.
  - No critical or high-severity defects open.
  - Automation reports and dashboards generated and verified.

## 8. Deliverables
- Test cases for functional, contract, backward compatibility, and performance testing.
- Automation scripts for regression and performance validation.
- Execution reports and dashboards.
- Defect logs and bug reports.
- Test summary report with metrics, observations, and recommendations.
## 9. Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Incomplete legacy test coverage → **Mitigation:** Review and update legacy test cases.
- **Risk:** Environment inconsistencies → **Mitigation:** Use containerized/stable test environments.
- **Risk:** API versioning conflicts → **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to versioning strategy and documentation.
- **Risk:** Performance degradation → **Mitigation:** Early performance testing and optimization.
- **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities → **Mitigation:** Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews.
- **Risk:** Delays in test execution → **Mitigation:** Parallelize testing and automate as much as possible.
- **Risk:** Miscommunication between teams → **Mitigation:** Regular sync-ups and clear documentation.
## 10. References
- vCenter API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI specs).
- Previous release notes and test plans.    
- Industry best practices for API testing and backward compatibility.
## 11. Timeline
- Week 1: Test plan finalization, environment setup.
- Week 2-3: Test case development and automation.       
- Week 4: Execution of functional, backward compatibility, and performance tests.
- Week 5: Defect triage, re-testing, and reporting.
- Week 6: Final review and sign-off.

# Test Plan – Backward Compatibility & REST APIs

## 1. Objective
- Ensure that new versions of REST APIs do not break existing functionality.
- Validate compatibility between older clients ↔ new APIs and new clients ↔ older APIs.
- Maintain consistent behavior, schema, and contracts across versions.

## 2. Scope
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Existing automation and client integrations continue to work with the new release.
  - Ensure no breaking changes in request/response schema, authentication, or error codes.
- **REST APIs:**
  - Functional validation of endpoints (CRUD operations).
  - Contract testing (request/response structure).
  - Performance & scalability validation.
  - Security validation (auth, TLS, RBAC).

## 3. Test Strategy
- **Versioning Tests:**
  - Run older API test suites against the new service.
  - Validate deprecated endpoints still function until officially retired.
  - Ensure consistent behavior for unchanged fields.
- **Contract Testing:**
  - Schema validation using tools like Postman, REST Assured, Pact, or Swagger/OpenAPI validators.
  - Check mandatory vs optional fields.
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Positive/negative scenarios.
  - Boundary value & error code handling.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Validate APIs when consumed by existing downstream systems or clients.
  - Simulate multi-version interaction in a staging environment.
- **Performance & Load Testing:**
  - Benchmark new vs old versions.
  - Ensure latency, throughput, and error rate do not degrade.
- **Security Testing:**
  - Authentication (tokens, OAuth, JWT).
  - RBAC and permission checks.
  - SSL/TLS enforcement.

## 4. Test Data
- Reuse datasets from earlier releases to validate legacy client scenarios.
- Create new datasets covering new fields/features.
- Edge cases: missing values, large payloads, invalid JSON.

## 5. Automation Approach
- **Framework:** REST Assured / Postman / Karate / PyTest + Requests.
- **Regression Suite:** Maintain API regression pack with version-specific validation.
- **Backward Compatibility Suite:**
  - Run tests against multiple versions (v1, v2, v3).
  - Compare responses for unchanged fields.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated execution on every build using Jenkins/GitHub Actions.

## 6. Reporting & Communication
- **Daily Status:** Shared in stand-ups.
- **Automated Reports:** Published to dashboards (Allure, ExtentReports, Grafana).
- **Weekly Sync:** QA + Dev + PM to review compatibility risks.

## 7. Entry & Exit Criteria
- **Entry:** New API version deployed in test/staging environment, old regression suite available.
- **Exit:** All backward compatibility and functional scenarios pass, no high-severity defects, automated reports generated.

## 8. Deliverables
