# New VM Placement Policy works correctly at scale

## 1. Introduction & Objective
- Understand feature requirements (functional + non-functional).
- Define success criteria: e.g., *“The new VM Placement Policy works correctly at scale, ensures accurate DRS recommendations, and does not impact existing workflows.”*

## 2. Scope
- **In-Scope:** Functional validation (API/UI), integration with core vCenter services (HA, DRS, vMotion, storage).
- **Out-of-Scope:** Legacy workflows unaffected by the feature unless regression testing highlights dependencies.

## 3. Test Approach
- **Unit & API Testing:** Validate the feature via REST API/SDK automation.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure correct interactions with hosts, clusters, networking, and storage.
- **Scale & Performance Testing:** Execute the feature on large-scale clusters (1k+ hosts, 10k+ VMs) to measure latency and throughput.
- **Resiliency Testing:** Simulate failures (service restarts, host failures, DB failover) to validate predictable behavior.
- **Upgrade & Compatibility Testing:** Verify functionality during upgrades and cross-product compatibility (NSX, vSAN, Horizon).
- **Security Testing:** Validate RBAC, authentication, and audit logging.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure existing workflows are unaffected.

## 4. Test Environment & Data
- Customer-like topologies: multi-datacenter, multi-cluster setups, heterogeneous ESXi versions.
- Environment provisioning automated via Ansible/Terraform.
- Test data sets (VMs, storage, policies) mimic real workloads.

## 5. Test Automation
- Extend **Python/Java automation framework** to cover new feature workflows.
- Integrate into **Jenkins CI/CD pipelines** for nightly execution.
- Metrics collection and dashboards via Grafana/ELK for scale/performance monitoring.

## 6. Entry & Exit Criteria
- **Entry:** Test environment ready, feature builds available, requirements signed off.
- **Exit:** All high-priority scenarios executed, no Sev1/Sev2 defects open, performance thresholds met, regression suite passes.

## 7. Risk & Mitigation
- Risk: DB load spikes → **Mitigation:** Run load/stress tests early.
- Risk: Cross-product compatibility gaps → **Mitigation:** Run interoperability tests with NSX/vSAN.

## 8. Reporting & Communication
- **Daily:** Test status updates in stand-ups.
- **Automated Reports:** Published to dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- **Weekly:** Sync with development team and PM to track progress, risks, and blockers.

## 9. Deliverables
- Test cases
- Automation scripts
- Execution reports
- Defect logs
- Test summary reports

# System Test Plan: Guest Live Customization VM Clone

**Feature:** Guest Live Customization during VM Clone  
**Application:** VMware vCenter  
**Prepared By:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Today’s Date]  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Objective
The objective of this system test plan is to validate the **Guest Live Customization** feature during VM cloning in vCenter. This includes customizing the guest OS, IP address, netmask, FQDN, and DNS settings on supported operating systems via the vCenter API.  

The tests will ensure that:
- VM cloning works successfully with live customization.
- Network and system configurations are applied correctly.
- The cloned VM is fully functional and accessible on the network.  

---

## 2. Scope
**In Scope:**
- Cloning VMs using vCenter with live guest customization.
- Applying customization parameters:  
  - Guest OS type  
  - IP Address  
  - Netmask  
  - FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)  
  - DNS servers  
- Verification via API and vSphere Client.  

**Out of Scope:**
- Unsupported OS types (live customization not supported).  
- VM cloning without customization.  
- Underlying vCenter infrastructure testing (assumed stable).  

---

## 3. Test Environment
- **vCenter Version:** [Specify version]  
- **ESXi Hosts:** [List host specs, e.g., CPU, RAM, network]  
- **Guest OS:** Supported Windows/Linux templates  
- **Network:** VLAN-enabled environment for IP validation  
- **Automation Tool:** PowerCLI / REST API / Postman  
- **Test Tools:** ping, nslookup, SSH/RDP  

---

## 4. Test Approach
- **Functional Testing:** Verify all customization parameters are applied correctly.  
- **Negative Testing:** Validate unsupported OS or invalid network parameters fail gracefully.  
- **API Testing:** Confirm vCenter API correctly accepts customization parameters.  
- **Post-Clone Validation:**  
  - VM boots successfully.  
  - Network settings applied.  
  - DNS and FQDN resolve correctly.  

---

## 5. Test Strategy
1. **Test Design:** Use a combination of manual and automated tests.  
2. **Test Data:**  
   - Guest OS templates (Windows Server, Linux variants).  
   - IP addresses and netmask ranges.  
   - FQDN examples (`vm1.test.local`).  
   - DNS servers (`8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`).  
3. **Execution:** Execute cloning using both UI and API for each test case.  
4. **Verification:** Validate cloned VM configuration using CLI, vSphere Client, and network tools.

## 6. Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-------|----------------|---------|
| TC-01 | Clone VM with guest OS customization | 1. Select template VM<br>2. Set guest OS type<br>3. Perform clone | Cloned VM has correct OS type | High |
| TC-02 | Clone VM with static IP and netmask | 1. Set IP and netmask in customization spec<br>2. Clone VM | VM boots with assigned IP and netmask | High |
| TC-03 | Clone VM with FQDN | 1. Set FQDN in customization spec<br>2. Clone VM | VM hostname matches FQDN | High |
| TC-04 | Clone VM with DNS servers | 1. Set DNS server addresses<br>2. Clone VM | VM resolves hostnames via configured DNS | High |
| TC-05 | API-based clone with all customization parameters | 1. Call vCenter API to clone VM with IP, netmask, FQDN, DNS | API returns success, VM config applied | High |
| TC-06 | Clone VM with unsupported OS | 1. Select unsupported OS<br>2. Attempt clone | Clone fails with proper error | Medium |
| TC-07 | Invalid IP or DNS in customization | 1. Provide invalid IP/DNS<br>2. Attempt clone | Clone fails or network misconfiguration detected | Medium |
| TC-08 | Verify network connectivity | 1. Ping cloned VM from host<br>2. SSH/RDP access | VM is reachable via configured IP | High |
| TC-09 | Validate guest OS customization logs | 1. Check vCenter logs or VM customization logs | Logs indicate customization applied successfully | Medium |

## 7. Entry Criteria
- vCenter is installed and reachable.

- Test environment prepared with ESXi hosts.  

---

## 8. Exit Criteria

## 9. Risks
- Unsupported guest OS may lead to failed customization.  
- Network misconfigurations during test may cause unreachable VMs.  
- vCenter API changes may impact automation scripts.  

---

## 10. Automation Considerations
- **PowerCLI scripts** to automate cloning and verification of VM properties.  
- **REST API tests** to validate cloning and customization via scripts (Python/PowerShell).  
- Validation of network configuration using `ping`, `nslookup`, and remote connection.
