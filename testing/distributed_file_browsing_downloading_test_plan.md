# Test Plan – Distributed File Browsing & Download System

**Date:** October 01, 2025  
**Author:** Grok (xAI)

This test plan outlines a comprehensive strategy for validating a distributed file browsing and download system, such as a distributed file system (DFS) inspired by HDFS, Ceph, or cloud-based solutions like S3 with multi-region replication. The system enables users to browse directories, search files, and download content across distributed nodes, ensuring high availability, data integrity, and scalability. Testing focuses on functional correctness (e.g., accurate listings), non-functional aspects (e.g., performance under load), fault tolerance (e.g., node failures), and security (e.g., access controls). It emphasizes automation for CI/CD integration, drawing from best practices in distributed systems testing, including chaos engineering, scalability assessments, and automated frameworks.

This plan aligns with standards like ISO 26262 for reliability in distributed environments and promotes shift-left testing for early defect detection.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This test plan defines the methodology for testing a distributed file browsing and download system to verify:
- **Data Integrity and Correctness**: Files are browsed, listed, and downloaded without corruption, loss, or inconsistencies across nodes.
- **Performance and Scalability**: High throughput (>1GB/s downloads), low latency (<100ms for listings), and handling of large-scale data (e.g., PB-level storage).
- **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**: Resilience to node failures, network partitions, and concurrent accesses, with consistent metadata and replication.
- **Security and Compliance**: Access controls, encryption, and auditability to prevent unauthorized browsing/downloads.
- **Usability**: Intuitive browsing (e.g., directory traversal, search) and features like resumable downloads.

Automation covers 85%+ of tests to enable rapid iterations in CI/CD, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness in distributed environments.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Functional testing of browsing (listings, search), downloading (integrity, resumes), and metadata handling.
  - Non-functional testing: Performance, scalability, chaos, security.
  - Integration with distributed storage (e.g., replication, sharding).
  - Automation for regression and end-to-end (E2E) flows.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Hardware-specific testing (e.g., disk I/O optimizations).
  - Full compliance audits (e.g., GDPR; covered in separate plans).
  - Client-side UI testing (focus on backend APIs/system).

## 2. Objectives
- Achieve 95%+ automation coverage for functional and regression tests.
- Validate data consistency in 100% of distributed scenarios (e.g., CAP theorem trade-offs).
- Ensure system handles 10,000+ concurrent users with <5% error rate.
- Detect regressions in <10 minutes via CI pipelines.
- Generate reports with metrics (e.g., download speed, failure recovery time).

## 3. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Access to multi-node clusters (e.g., Kubernetes for simulation).
- Synthetic file generators for large datasets (e.g., 1TB+).
- CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) configured for execution.
- Team expertise in distributed systems (e.g., C++/Java for core, Python for tests).

## 4. Test Strategy

### 4.1 Approach
Use a layered, fault-aware strategy:
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify core operations (browsing, downloading) with diverse datasets (small/large files, deep hierarchies).
2. **Non-Functional Testing**: Assess load, chaos, and scalability with emulators/simulators.
3. **Property-Based Testing**: Use random inputs (e.g., Hypothesis) to assert invariants like consistency.
4. **Automation Scripts**: Automate cluster setups and test execution for repeatability.
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Run tests on every commit; notify via Slack/email on failures.

### 4.2 Test Levels
| Level | Description | Focus | Automation % |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Unit | Individual modules (e.g., metadata handler). | Logic, edge cases. | 100% |
| Integration | Node interactions (e.g., replication). | Consistency, APIs. | 90% |
| End-to-End (E2E) | Full flows (browse → download). | Usability, integrity. | 80% |
| Performance | Load and chaos testing. | Throughput, resilience. | 70% |
| Security | Access controls, encryption. | Vulnerabilities. | 85% |

### 4.3 Automation Framework
- **Languages/Tools**: Python (Pytest) for scripting; C++ (Google Test) for core components.
- **Orchestration**: Testcontainers for ephemeral clusters; Kubernetes for scaling tests.
- **Assertions**: Checksums for file integrity; temporal assertions for eventual consistency.
- **CI/CD**: Parallel test runs; fail builds on >1% error rate.
- **Reporting**: Allure dashboards for test results; integrate with Prometheus for metrics.

## 5. Tools and Environment
| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Testing Framework | Pytest, Google Test | Automation of functional and unit tests. |
| Simulation | Testcontainers, Minikube | Multi-node cluster simulation. |
| Load/Chaos | JMeter, Chaos Toolkit | Simulate high load and fault injection. |
| Security | OWASP ZAP | Vulnerability scanning for APIs. |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana | Metrics collection and visualization. |
| Environment | Docker, Kubernetes | Isolated test environments. |

- **Environment**: Local (Docker Compose) for development; Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) for staging.
- **Data**: Synthetic file generators (e.g., `dd` for binary files); anonymized production-like samples.
