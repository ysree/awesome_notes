# Create Test Plan for firmware upgrade 
# Test Plan: Firmware Upgrade

#### 1. Objective
To validate that the firmware upgrade process completes successfully without data loss, system crashes, or functionality degradation. Ensure rollback works in case of failures.

---

#### 2. Scope
- Covers firmware upgrade on devices (routers, IoT devices, servers, embedded systems).
- Includes pre-upgrade checks, upgrade process validation, and post-upgrade verification.
- Excludes hardware failures unrelated to firmware.

---

#### 3. Assumptions
- Firmware image is verified and compatible with the device.
- Backup of existing firmware and configuration is available.
- Device has sufficient power and storage for upgrade.

---

#### 4. Preconditions
- Device powered on and reachable.
- Proper network connection if upgrade is over-the-air (OTA).
- Admin privileges for performing upgrade.
- Logs and monitoring enabled.

---

#### 5. Test Scenarios & Steps

##### Scenario 1: Pre-upgrade Verification
- Verify current firmware version.
- Check device storage and battery/power status.
- Ensure backup of current firmware/configuration.
**Expected Result:** All checks pass; device ready for upgrade.

##### Scenario 2: Upgrade Execution
- Apply firmware upgrade via supported method (OTA, USB, manual).
- Monitor upgrade progress.
**Expected Result:** Firmware upgrade completes without errors; device reboots successfully.

##### Scenario 3: Post-upgrade Verification
- Verify new firmware version.
- Check system logs for errors during upgrade.
- Test device functionality (network, services, I/O).
**Expected Result:** Device operates normally; all features functional.

##### Scenario 4: Upgrade Failure Handling
- Simulate interruption (power loss, network failure) during upgrade.
- Attempt automatic or manual rollback.
**Expected Result:** Device restores previous firmware without corruption.

##### Scenario 5: Stress/Load Testing Post Upgrade
- Execute heavy usage scenarios to ensure stability.
**Expected Result:** No crashes, data loss, or performance degradation.

##### Scenario 6: Security Verification
- Check firmware signature and integrity.
- Validate that upgrade process is secure (no unauthorized modification).
**Expected Result:** Firmware integrity verified; no security vulnerabilities introduced.

---

#### 6. Validation Checks
- Firmware version correctly updated.
- Device functionality unaffected.
- Logs show successful upgrade and no errors.
- Rollback works in case of failures.
- Network and system services operational.

---

#### 7. Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Pass:** Device upgraded successfully, all features functional, rollback works if required.
- **Fail:** Upgrade fails, device crashes, or functionality is lost after upgrade.

---

#### 8. Tools Needed
- Firmware upgrade tools/software.
- Device monitoring and logging tools.
- Network connectivity and power monitoring tools.
- Automated test scripts for post-upgrade functionality.

---

#### 9. Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Power failure during upgrade.  
  **Mitigation:** Ensure backup power or UPS.
- **Risk:** Network failure during OTA upgrade.  
  **Mitigation:** Retry mechanism or local upgrade option.
- **Risk:** Corrupted firmware image.  
  **Mitigation:** Verify checksum before upgrade.
