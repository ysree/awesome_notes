# vCenter API System Test Plan

## 1. Objective
The objective of this test plan is to validate the **vCenter REST and SOAP APIs** for correctness, reliability, performance, security, and scalability. The goal is to ensure that APIs behave as expected in production-scale environments and integrate correctly with clients and automation tools.

---

## 2. Scope
This test plan covers the following:
- Functional validation of vCenter APIs (VM, Host, Cluster, Datastore, Network management)
- Performance testing under load
- Security and authorization validation
- Error handling and fault tolerance
- Regression testing for backward compatibility
- API usability and consistency across different vCenter versions

---

## 3. References
- vSphere API Reference Guide  
- vCenter API Explorer  
- vCenter REST API Documentation  
- Automation Framework Specification  
- Security and Compliance Guidelines

## 4. Test Environment Setup

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **vCenter** | 2 vCenters (Primary and Secondary) in Linked Mode |
| **ESXi Hosts** | 32–64 hosts per cluster |
| **Network** | vDS with multiple port groups for management, VM, and vMotion |
| **VMs** | 500–1000 VMs (Linux and Windows) |
| **Clients** | REST and SOAP clients with authentication tokens |
| **Automation** | Python/Java-based automation scripts with CI/CD integration |
| **Monitoring** | Grafana, Prometheus, vCenter logs, API call metrics |

---

## 5. Test Strategy

### 5.1 Functional Validation
- Verify CRUD operations on key objects: VM, Host, Cluster, Datastore, Network  
- Validate querying APIs (list, filter, search) return accurate and complete data  
- Validate transactional operations (power on/off, migrate, clone) via APIs  
- Check input validation and error messages for invalid requests  

### 5.2 Performance & Scalability
- Measure API response times under varying loads (10–1000 concurrent requests)  
- Validate throughput for bulk operations (e.g., creating 100 VMs via API)  
- Test API behavior under high vCenter load (many tasks, events, or migrations running)

### 5.3 Security & Authorization
- Validate role-based access control (RBAC) enforcement on all APIs  
- Check token expiration, refresh, and invalid credential handling  
- Test APIs for unauthorized access attempts  
- Validate audit logs for API calls

### 5.4 Fault Tolerance & Error Handling
- Validate API behavior during network interruptions  
- Test API responses when backend services are temporarily unavailable  
- Validate retry mechanisms and rollback behavior for failed operations  

### 5.5 Regression Testing
- Verify backward compatibility for existing APIs  
- Ensure deprecated APIs handle requests gracefully with proper warnings

### 5.6 Automation Coverage
- All functional, performance, and security scenarios automated using REST/SOAP clients  
- Scheduled nightly regression to validate API stability across builds

## 6. Test Scenarios

| **Test ID** | **Category** | **Test Case Description** | **Expected Result** |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|

| TC_API_FUNC_002 | Functional | Query host and cluster information | Correct details returned; no missing or invalid data |
| TC_API_FUNC_003 | Functional | Perform VM power operations (on/off/reboot) | VM state changes as expected; no errors |
| TC_API_FUNC_004 | Functional | Clone VM using API | VM cloned successfully with correct configuration |

| TC_API_PERF_002 | Performance | Bulk create 50 VMs simultaneously | All VMs created successfully; cluster remains stable |
| TC_API_SEC_001 | Security | Access API with invalid token | API rejects request with proper error code |
| TC_API_SEC_002 | Security | Verify RBAC for restricted role | API enforces permissions; restricted actions fail |
| TC_API_FAULT_001 | Fault Tolerance | Interrupt network during API operation | Operation retries or fails gracefully without corruption |
| TC_API_REG_001 | Regression | Validate previously working APIs after new feature deployment | APIs continue to work as expected; no regressions |

---

## 7. Entry and Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria**
- Environments deployed and stable  
- API endpoints accessible and documented  
- Test automation environment ready

**Exit Criteria**
- All planned test scenarios executed  
- No critical/high severity defects open  
- Performance and security thresholds met  
- Automation regression passes for 3 consecutive runs

---

## 8. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API endpoints unavailable due to maintenance | Schedule tests during stable windows |
| High load causing cluster instability | Use test clusters with controlled load |
| Security test failures impacting production | Use isolated test environment for RBAC/security tests |
