# API and SDK Debugging Strategy

## **Objective**
To provide a structured approach for troubleshooting complex issues in API and SDK testing, incorporating network latency, disk I/O, CPU, memory, payload and schema validation, log analysis, and network and protocol debugging, while ensuring alignment with high-quality validation standards and traceability.

| **Aspect** | **Debugging Strategy** | **Tools/Techniques** | **Key Considerations** |
|------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Issue Identification** | - **Reproduce the Issue**: Replicate issues using test cases, sample apps, or real-world scenarios.<br>- **Analyze Test Failures**: Review failed tests (unit, integration, performance) to identify symptoms (e.g., HTTP 500, timeouts).<br>- **Check Logs**: Examine SDK/API logs for errors, stack traces, or resource-related warnings (e.g., high memory usage, disk I/O errors).<br>- **Monitor System Metrics**: Collect network latency, disk I/O, CPU, and memory usage during test execution.<br>- **Use Traceability Matrix**: Map issues to requirements to prioritize critical functionalities (e.g., payment APIs).<br>- **Example**: If `auth.login` API fails with HTTP 503, check network latency, server logs, and payload validation errors. | - Test frameworks: JUnit, pytest, Jest<br>- Logging: Log4j, SLF4J, Winston<br>- API testing: Postman, Insomnia<br>- Monitoring: New Relic, Prometheus, Grafana<br>- TestRail/Jira for traceability | - Ensure reproducible steps with consistent inputs and environments.<br>- Monitor system metrics during issue reproduction.<br>- Prioritize issues affecting critical functionalities using traceability matrix. |

## **Debugging Workflow with Resource Monitoring**
1. **Reproduce and Isolate**:
   - Replicate issue in controlled environments (e.g., sample app, emulator).
   - Monitor network latency, disk I/O, CPU, memory, and protocol issues.
2. **Gather Data**:
   - Collect logs, stack traces, network traffic, and system metrics (e.g., iostat, Wireshark).
   - Validate payloads against schemas; analyze logs for errors.
   - Compare against KPIs (e.g., latency <100ms, CPU <50%).
3. **Analyze**:
   - Use debuggers to trace code execution.
   - Analyze network traffic and protocols for delays or errors.
   - Validate payload schemas and correlate log events with metrics.
4. **Hypothesize and Test**:
   - Test hypotheses (e.g., high disk I/O due to logging, schema mismatch).
   - Adjust inputs, mock dependencies, or simulate network conditions.
5. **Resolve and Verify**:
   - Implement fixes (e.g., optimize queries, fix schemas).
   - Re-run tests and monitor system metrics to confirm resolution.
   - Update traceability matrix and KPIs (e.g., error rate, MTTR).
6. **Document and Prevent**:
   - Log root causes and fixes in Jira.
   - Add test cases for new edge cases (e.g., invalid payloads, protocol errors).
   - Share insights to improve SDK/API design.

- **Unit Test Coverage**: High coverage (≥95% for critical APIs) ensures issues are caught early, with debugging focused on failed tests.
- **Traceability Matrix**: Maps issues to requirements, ensuring critical functionalities (e.g., `processPayment`) are debugged thoroughly.
- **KPIs**: Debug outcomes improve KPIs like latency (<100ms), error rate (<1%), and resource usage (e.g., CPU <50%, memory <100MB).
- **SDK/API Validation**: Debugging addresses functionality, performance, compatibility, and integration, with added focus on network, disk, CPU, memory, payload validation, log analysis, and protocol debugging.
