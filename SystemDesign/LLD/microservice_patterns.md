## 1. Decomposition Patterns

### 1.1 Decompose by Business Capability

**Definition:**
Break down a monolithic application based on business capabilities such as ‚ÄúOrder Management,‚Äù ‚ÄúPayment,‚Äù or ‚ÄúInventory.‚Äù

**Example:**

* Amazon splits services into independent capabilities: `Orders`, `Payments`, `Delivery`.

**Usecase:**
When your application is large and each domain can evolve independently.

**Explanation:**
Each service aligns with a business function, enabling independent scaling, ownership, and releases.

**Advantages:**

* High cohesion within services
* Easier to assign teams per domain

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires deep domain understanding

---

### 1.2 Decompose by Subdomain

**Definition:**
Based on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** ‚Äî split system by bounded contexts (core, supporting, generic).

**Example:**
E-commerce app split into:

* Core: `Order`, `Payment`
* Supporting: `Shipping`, `Inventory`

**Usecase:**
When domain knowledge is well understood and bounded contexts are clear.

**Advantages:**

* Better alignment with domain model
* Easier to evolve core domains

**Disadvantages:**

* Initial setup complex

---

## 2. Integration Patterns

### 2.1 API Gateway

**Definition:**
A single entry point for all client requests, routing to appropriate microservices.

**Example:**

* Netflix Zuul, AWS API Gateway

**Usecase:**
When multiple clients (web, mobile) need access to backend microservices.

**Explanation:**
API Gateway handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing requests.

**Advantages:**

* Centralized entry point
* Simplifies client code

**Disadvantages:**

* Potential single point of failure

---

### 2.2 Backend for Frontend (BFF)

**Definition:**
Create separate backends for different types of clients (mobile, web, IoT).

**Example:**
Netflix uses separate BFFs for TV, mobile, and web apps.

**Usecase:**
When each client requires different data views or API responses.

**Advantages:**

* Optimized API per client
* Reduces over-fetching

**Disadvantages:**

* More code maintenance

---

### 2.3 Service Registry and Discovery

**Definition:**
Allows services to register and discover each other dynamically at runtime.

**Example:**
Eureka (Netflix), Consul, or Kubernetes Service Discovery.

**Usecase:**
When service instances change dynamically due to scaling.

**Advantages:**

* Dynamic service registration
* Fault tolerance

**Disadvantages:**

* Added complexity for setup

---

## 3. Database Patterns

### 3.1 Database per Service

**Definition:**
Each service has its own database to ensure loose coupling.

**Example:**
Order Service ‚Üí MySQL
Payment Service ‚Üí PostgreSQL

**Usecase:**
When you want service autonomy and independent schema updates.

**Advantages:**

* No shared schema dependencies
* Scalability per service

**Disadvantages:**

* Data consistency challenges

---

### 3.2 Shared Database

**Definition:**
Multiple services share a single database schema.

**Example:**
Order and Payment services using a common DB table for transactions.

**Usecase:**
When splitting databases is not feasible initially.

**Advantages:**

* Easier joins and transactions

**Disadvantages:**

* Tight coupling
* Deployment dependencies

---

### 3.3 Saga Pattern

**Definition:**
Manages distributed transactions across multiple services using a sequence of local transactions with compensations.

**Example:**
Order ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Inventory; if payment fails, order is cancelled.

**Usecase:**
When transactions span multiple services without distributed locks.

**Advantages:**

* Ensures data consistency
* No need for 2PC (two-phase commit)

**Disadvantages:**

* Complex to implement and debug

---

## 4. Observability Patterns

### 4.1 Log Aggregation

**Definition:**
Centralize logs from all microservices.

**Example:**
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

**Usecase:**
When debugging issues across services.

**Advantages:**

* Centralized analysis
* Simplifies troubleshooting

**Disadvantages:**

* High storage and processing cost

---

### 4.2 Distributed Tracing

**Definition:**
Track requests as they traverse multiple microservices.

**Example:**
Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray

**Usecase:**
To identify latency bottlenecks in service chains.

**Advantages:**

* Detect slow services
* Full request visibility

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires instrumentation

---

### 4.3 Health Check API

**Definition:**
Each service exposes an endpoint (e.g., `/health`) for monitoring availability.

**Usecase:**
Used by orchestration tools like Kubernetes for liveness/readiness probes.

**Advantages:**

* Early failure detection
* Auto-restart unhealthy services

**Disadvantages:**

* Must implement across all services

---

## 5. Resiliency Patterns

### 5.1 Circuit Breaker

**Definition:**
Stops calling a service that‚Äôs repeatedly failing to prevent cascading failures.

**Example:**
Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j

**Usecase:**
When a dependent service becomes unavailable.

**Advantages:**

* Improves fault tolerance
* Prevents system overload

**Disadvantages:**

* Adds delay in recovery

---

### 5.2 Retry Pattern

**Definition:**
Automatically retries failed requests with backoff strategy.

**Example:**
Spring Retry, Resilience4j Retry

**Usecase:**
When transient network failures occur.

**Advantages:**

* Recovers from temporary issues

**Disadvantages:**

* Can worsen load if not throttled

---

### 5.3 Bulkhead Pattern

**Definition:**
Isolate resources so a failure in one service doesn‚Äôt impact others.

**Example:**
Separate thread pools for each microservice.

**Usecase:**
When one module should not exhaust shared resources.

**Advantages:**

* Limits fault propagation

**Disadvantages:**

* Resource underutilization

---

## 6. Security Patterns

### 6.1 Access Token (JWT)

**Definition:**
Authenticate users with short-lived JSON Web Tokens.

**Usecase:**
When multiple services require user authentication.

**Advantages:**

* Stateless, scalable authentication

**Disadvantages:**

* Token revocation complex

---

### 6.2 API Gateway Authentication

**Definition:**
Centralize authentication at API Gateway level.

**Usecase:**
To enforce security policies globally.

**Advantages:**

* Simplifies service logic
* Uniform security enforcement

**Disadvantages:**

* Gateway becomes critical dependency

---

## 7. Deployment Patterns

### 7.1 Sidecar Pattern

**Definition:**
Attach helper containers alongside main service containers.

**Example:**
Envoy proxy with application container.

**Usecase:**
Logging, proxying, or monitoring per service.

**Advantages:**

* Separation of concerns
* Reusable sidecars

**Disadvantages:**

* Increased pod complexity

---

### 7.2 Service Mesh

**Definition:**
Manages service-to-service communication through a proxy layer.

**Example:**
Istio, Linkerd

**Usecase:**
When traffic management, telemetry, and security are required across services.

**Advantages:**

* Uniform observability and control
* Offloads networking logic from code

**Disadvantages:**

* High operational overhead
