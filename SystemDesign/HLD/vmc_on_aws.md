# VMC on AWS upgrades
#### Who Manages Upgrades
- VMware is fully responsible for upgrades in VMC on AWS (not the customer).
- Customers can choose upgrade windows (maintenance preference), but can‚Äôt control the upgrade process itself**.

**Upgrades cover:**
- **Management Plane** ‚Üí vCenter, NSX, HCX appliances, VMware‚Äôs management stack.
- **Data Plane** ‚Üí ESXi hosts, vSAN, networking datapath.
- **RCE (Release Control Plane)** ‚Üí orchestrates upgrades across customers.
- **RLCM (Release Lifecycle Manager)** ‚Üí executes the lifecycle workflows (patch, rollback, re-image).

#### Upgrade Execution

Upgrades happen in a phased order:

- Step 1 ‚Äì Management Plane
    - vCenter Server is upgraded first (new appliance or patched).
    - NSX Manager upgraded/redeployed ‚Üí ensures networking and security stack is - up-to-date.
    - HCX appliances (if used) are updated.
    - RLCM ensures rollback option by using pre-upgrade backups.
- Step 2 ‚Äì ESXi Hosts (Rolling Upgrade)
    - Hosts are upgraded one at a time:
        - Host is placed in maintenance mode.
        - vMotion migrates running VMs to other hosts (no downtime).
        - Upgrade or re-image of ESXi is performed.
        - Host exits maintenance ‚Üí VMs may return via DRS load balancing.
    - Repeat until all hosts are upgraded.
- Step 3 ‚Äì vSAN
    - Since vSAN is tied to ESXi kernel, vSAN bits are upgraded during ESXi upgrade.
    - Metadata and objects are upgraded after all hosts are on new version.
    - This is online and non-disruptive.

# End-to-End Upgrade + Backup/Restore Flow
- RLCM schedules upgrade ‚Üí notifies tenant.
- RCE runs pre-checks (health, capacity, HA).
- Backup of management plane components taken automatically.
- Upgrade executed step by step (vCenter ‚Üí NSX ‚Üí ESXi hosts)- 
- If failure- 
    - RLCM restores from backup ‚Üí full rollback to pre-upgrade state.
- If success:
    - Backups retired, new version becomes active.

#Customer Workloads During Upgrade
- No downtime expected:
    - Workload VMs are vMotioned live.
    - HA/DRS maintain VM placement.
- Customers don‚Äôt need to shut down workloads.
- If extra safety is needed ‚Üí customers may run their own workload-level backups (VCDR, Veeam, etc.).

# What is PoP in VMC on AWS?
In VMC on AWS, a PoP (Point of Presence) is the network edge node managed by VMware that connects your SDDC to AWS, VMware services, and the Internet.

- Deployed in a redundant architecture across multiple availability zones.
- Ensures failover in case of a PoP or link outage.
- Provides service continuity during upgrades or failures.

#### Its main roles & responsibilities are:
- Connectivity (VPN, Direct Connect, AWS services)
- Traffic management (routing, ingress/egress control)
- Security enforcement (firewall, NAT, segmentation)
- Service integration (linking VMware + AWS + on-prem)
- Resiliency (HA, failover, redundancy)

------
# RCE PRE - POST Checks
### 1. Pre-Upgrade Checks (Before Upgrade Starts)
‚úÖ Management Plane
- vCenter health:
    - Appliance services running.
    - Database consistency.
    - API/UI responsiveness.
- NSX Manager health:
    - Cluster nodes reachable.
    - Management/control/data plane functional.
    - Edge node status (if applicable).
- HCX appliances (if deployed): health and reachability.

‚úÖ Cluster/Host Level
- Host state:
    - No hosts in a failed/disconnected state.
    - Sufficient cluster resources (CPU, memory).
    - DRS enabled and functioning.
- **vMotion health:** ensure VMs can be migrated during rolling host upgrades.
- **HA configuration:** validated so failover works if needed.
- **Host maintenance mode readiness:** confirm workloads can evacuate safely.

‚úÖ vSAN (Storage)
- vSAN Health service checks:
    - Cluster partition status (all nodes in same cluster).
    - Disk group health.
    - Component state (no inaccessible objects).
    - Storage policy compliance.
    - Resync queue empty (no outstanding object rebuilds).
- Capacity check:
    - Enough free space for ‚ÄúEnsure Accessibility‚Äù or ‚ÄúRAID-1 FTT=1‚Äù operations.

‚úÖ Networking
- NSX logical switch/segment health.
- Routing and firewall rule consistency.
- Connectivity between hosts for vSAN and vMotion networks.

‚úÖ Operational
- **Upgrade compatibility matrix:** verify current version is supported for target upgrade.
- **Temporary host capacity:** check if a non-billable spare host is needed for rolling upgrade.
- **Snapshot/backup of management appliances** created.

### 2. Post-Upgrade Checks (After Upgrade Completes)

‚úÖ Management Plane
- **vCenter**: upgraded version running, services healthy, API/UI reachable.
- **NSX Manager**: cluster status green, control/data plane functional.
- **HCX appliances**: operational and registered correctly.

‚úÖ Cluster/Host Level
- All hosts upgraded and in connected state.
- DRS & HA functional after upgrade.
- VMs distributed properly across cluster.
- No host in maintenance mode after completion.

‚úÖ vSAN (Storage)
- All hosts on same vSAN version.
- Disk format upgrade status: started/complete, no failures.
- No resync backlog.
- Objects compliant with storage policies.
- Deduplication/compression state verified (for node types that support it).

‚úÖ Networking
- Overlay/underlay connectivity validated.
- Edge services (NAT, VPN, load balancer) functional.
- Distributed firewall rules intact.

‚úÖ Operational
- Teemetry back to RCE ‚Üí confirms successful upgrade.
- Logs validated for errors during upgrade.
- Temporary host removed if one was added.
- Rollback checkpoints cleaned up (backups retired).

# BRS (Backup and Restore Service) in VMC on AWS
- It‚Äôs an internal service used by VMware to protect the management plane during operations like upgrades or patching.
- Customers do not interact with BRS directly (no self-service backup/restore).

- Backups are stored in a separate, secure AWS S3 bucket managed by VMware inside the Service Provider‚Äôs (VMware‚Äôs) AWS account, not the customer‚Äôs account.
- The bucket is region-specific and located in the same region as your SDDC to avoid latency.
- Backups are encrypted (AES-256 at rest) and replicated across multiple AZs for durability

## When Does BRS Run?
#### 1. Before critical lifecycle events:
- SDDC upgrades (vCenter, NSX, HCX, ESXi/vSAN upgrades).
- Management component patching.
- Some catastrophic recovery operations triggered by VMware Support.

#### 2. What Components Does BRS Protect?
 BRS backs up management plane only, not customer VMs. Specifically:
- vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA)
    - Configuration database
    - Inventory (clusters, hosts, resource pools, VMs, templates)
    - Identity sources and permissions
- NSX Manager/NSX-T Manager
    - Management plane configuration
    - Control plane state
    - Networking objects (segments, T1/T0 gateways, firewall rules, routing policies, security groups, etc.)
- Control plane configuration, policies, security rules, routing tables.
- HCX Manager (if deployed).
    - Site pairing configuration
    - Service mesh setup
    - Migration plans and settings
- SDDC configuration metadata
    -  Cluster layout, networking (segments, gateways, firewall rules), identity sources, certificates.
- vSAN Configuration Metadata
    - Disk group layout, object metadata
    - Cluster policies (SPBM rules)

**Note** : 
- üëâ It does NOT back up workload VMs or vSAN datastore data.
- üëâ Customer VMs must be protected by customer-owned solutions (VCDR, Veeam, etc.).

#### 3. How BRS Takes Backups
- RCE triggers BRS before upgrades.
- BRS creates application-consistent snapshots of management appliances.
- Backups are stored in an internal VMware-managed repository (isolated, secure, not exposed to customer).
- They are short-lived, kept only until upgrade completes successfully.

#### 4. What Happens if Upgrade Fails?
- Failure during management plane upgrade (example: NSX upgrade crashes mid-way):
    - RLCM detects failure ‚Üí instructs BRS to restore affected components from pre-upgrade backup.
    - Example: redeploy NSX Manager VMs from backup image, restore config.
- Failure during host/vSAN upgrade:
    - Hosts are stateless and can be re-imaged back to the old ESXi/vSAN version.
    - vSAN data remains intact (since it‚Äôs distributed and redundant).
- Once restore completes ‚Üí SDDC is back to last known good state before upgrade.

#### 5. What Happens if Upgrade Succeeds?
- After successful upgrade, those BRS backups are deleted.
- They are not for long-term recovery.
- New version becomes the active baseline.

#### 6. Restore Workflow if Upgrade Fails
If an upgrade fails at any stage:
- BRS detects the failure (through RLCM/RCE monitoring).
- The failed component (say, NSX Manager) is rolled back by restoring from the last BRS backup.
- Restore is component-specific (only the failed component is restored, not the whole SDDC).
- If multiple dependencies are impacted, BRS can orchestrate a multi-component restore (for example, NSX Manager + vCenter).
- Once restore is complete, the system is validated for consistency before retrying upgrade.

# vSan on AWS
In VMC on AWS, you don‚Äôt manually set up vSAN like you would in an on-prem vSphere cluster. VMware abstracts and automates it for you, but under the hood it‚Äôs still standard vSAN technology with some AWS-specific integration. **Let‚Äôs break it down:**

- Every SDDC cluster in VMC uses vSAN as its primary storage for both management VMs (vCenter, NSX, HCX appliances) and customer workload VMs.
- There‚Äôs no separate SAN/NAS in VMC. Storage is fully integrated into the ESXi hosts via vSAN.
### 1. How vSAN is Enabled
- When you deploy an SDDC:
- VMware automatically enables vSAN across all ESXi hosts in the cluster.
- Each ESXi host in AWS has:
- NVMe flash devices for cache tier.
- NVMe capacity devices for capacity tier.
- These devices are claimed by vSAN and form a single distributed datastore that you see as vsanDatastore in vCenter.
- we don‚Äôt run esxcli vsan ... commands or configure disk groups; it‚Äôs part of the SDDC automation.

### How vSAN is Configured
**Disk Groups:** Automatically created ‚Äî each host contributes both cache and capacity devices.
**Deduplication & Compression:**
    - Enabled for i3 nodes (all-flash).
    - Not supported on some newer node types (e.g., i4i) because they use more efficient high-density NVMe.
**Storage Policy-Based Management (SPBM):**
    - You define policies (FTT=1, RAID-1 vs RAID-5/6, stripe width, etc.).
    - vSAN ensures data placement based on policy.
**vSAN Datastore:**
    - Exposed as a single datastore to all cluster hosts.
    - Expands automatically when you add hosts.

### Integration with AWS
**Capacity Scaling:**
- You scale storage by adding hosts (scale-out).
- There‚Äôs no native vSAN scale-up by adding disks, because AWS node SKUs are fied.
**Elastic vSAN (with EBS):**
- In newer offerings, you can extend vSAN capacity with Amazon EBS volumes instead of adding a full ESXi host (cost optimization).
- This is enabled/configured by VMware ‚Äî you request storage expansion in the console, and vSAN automatically adds EBS-backed capacity.
**Encryption:**
- All vSAN datastores are encrypted by default using vSAN Encryption with AWS **KMS** integration (no manual setup required).

### Management / Operations
**From vCenter in VMC, you can:**
- View vsanDatastore.
- Create/modify storage policies.
- Monitor capacity, IOPS, latency, dedupe ratios.
**What you cannot do:**
- Manually configure disk groups, enable/disable dedupe/compression, or mix disk types.
- These are fixed by VMware‚Äôs managed service design.

# HCX

VMware HCX (Hybrid Cloud Extension) is an application mobility platform that simplifies and automates the migration, rebalancing, and continuity of workloads across on-premises vSphere environments and different cloud platforms. It achieves this by creating a secure, optimized, and high-throughput hybrid network interconnect, allowing for seamless live or bulk migration of virtual machines (VMs) between sites
- **Key Benefits**
    - **Zero Downtime Migrations**: Performs live migrations without disrupting operations. 
    - **IP Address Preservation**: Workloads retain their original IP addresses and network configurations post-migration. 
    - **Enhanced Security**: Secures migration traffic with strong encryption. 
    - **WAN Optimization**: Improves migration performance over the WAN with de-duplication and traffic engineering.
