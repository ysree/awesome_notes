# Tell me about yourself
I am a having 18 years of industry experience, including the last 9 years at VMware 

I’m currently working as an Individual Contributor **IC5** for the Orchestration Fabric platform within the **VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) SaaS control plane**. 

I am responsible for the development of Orchestration Fabric, a fully managed service on AWS infrastructure, enabling customers to run VMware workloads on AWS.

Orchestration Fabric, which is technically a **“tasks-as-a-service”** platform that simplifies the development and execution of asynchronous workflows across VMC. Today, over **50 microservices** from multiple **VMware business units** are integrated with it — relying on us for reliable orchestration, lifecycle automation, and high availability.

I own the **end-to-end design, architecture, development, and operationalization of the platform**. We maintain a **99.99% SLA**, which is critical since our workflows power core operations like SDDC provisioning, lifecycle management, patching, and upgrades.

Technically, our stack includes **Spring Boot (Java) for backend microservices, Python for automation and tooling, PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for caching, and Kubernetes for container orchestration**. Our **CI/CD pipelines are automated using Jenkins, Groovy, and shell scripts**.

I’ve driven key initiatives such as **building a Kubernetes-based workflow engine, enhancing CI/CD automation frameworks, and improving observability and resiliency in production**. 

For instance, during phased upgrade workflows, we leverage **vMotion** for live migrations and Quick Boot for fast host restarts, ensuring that customer workloads stay uninterrupted even during major lifecycle events.

**Collaborate** with testers, DevOps, and SRE teams to identify, triage, and resolve issues quickly.

**Document** code, APIs, and workflows to support maintainability and operational readiness.

**Proactively monitor** systems and support operations, especially during SDDC upgrades, maintenance windows, or critical incidents.

Beyond architecture, I focus on technical leadership and developer enablement — mentoring engineers, driving design and code reviews, and improving the developer experience for the 400+ engineers who consume our platform.

What I really enjoy is aligning technical depth with business value — building platforms that unburden customers from operational complexity so they can focus on innovation. I’m passionate about designing reliable, scalable, and automated cloud systems that directly contribute to customer satisfaction and operational excellence.

Going forward, I’m excited about opportunities where I can apply my platform engineering and leadership experience to drive architecture strategy, cloud automation, and cross-team innovation — continuing to bridge reliability, scale, and simplicity in large distributed systems.

# Tell me about a challenge you recently came across and how you resolved it.
One of the most challenging situations I faced recently was when our Orchestration Fabric platform, which powers asynchronous workflow execution for 100+ microservices in VMware Cloud on AWS, started seeing sporadic workflow execution delays in production.

**Situation**:
This was critical because our platform drives lifecycle workflows for customer SDDCs — including provisioning, upgrades, and patching. Even small latency spikes could delay SDDC upgrades or backups, impacting SLAs and customer confidence. The challenge was that the issue was intermittent — there were no hard failures, but workflows that typically completed in seconds were occasionally taking several minutes.

**Task**:
As the technical lead for the platform, I needed to identify the root cause, mitigate customer impact, and ensure long-term reliability. Our SLA target is 99.99%, so even small degradations were unacceptable.

**Action**:
I formed a tiger team with developers, SREs, and database engineers to investigate across layers — application logic, Redis caching, PostgreSQL performance, and Kubernetes infrastructure.

After deep analysis using distributed tracing and metrics correlation, we discovered that certain workflow payloads were causing Redis connection saturation under specific load patterns. Some client microservices were holding connections longer than expected during retries, which reduced available connections for others, leading to cascading latency.

To resolve it, we:

Enhanced our connection pool configuration to use a bounded pool with backpressure and circuit-breaking logic.

Introduced async I/O and request batching for frequently called metadata queries to Redis.

Added connection telemetry metrics into our Prometheus dashboards for early detection.

Updated our SDK used by 400+ developers so that connection management was handled more efficiently by default.

We rolled out the fix through canary deployments and progressive rollouts, closely monitoring latency and Redis utilization metrics.

**Result***:
The changes reduced workflow latency variance by over 80%, stabilized Redis utilization, and improved the overall throughput of our orchestration engine by around 30%.

Beyond the fix, we also updated our design and developer documentation and held a knowledge-sharing session across integrated teams to prevent similar issues in future.
