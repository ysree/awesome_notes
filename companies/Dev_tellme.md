# Professional Summary  
- I am a Staff Engineer with 18 years of industry experience, including the last 9 years at VMware in the vSphere Solutions team. My primary focus is on building frameworks, tools, and automation solutions that validate large-scale vCenter systems.

- In this role, I handle greenfield deployments, feature validation through automation, and simulation of customer topologies and configurations at scale. I also design and implement Day-2 operation workflows covering vCenter performance benchmarking, resiliency, uptime stress, and monitoring for large-scale enterprise deployments.

- Additionally, I lead automation initiatives for the team, including designing automation frameworks, building CI/CD pipelines, and implementing observability solutions. These efforts have consistently improved reliability, scalability, and customer confidence in our products.

## Automation & Frameworks  
- Designed and implemented **end-to-end automation frameworks** for regression, performance, scalability, and resiliency testing.  
- Built a **Kubernetes-based workflow orchestration engine** enabling greenfield deployments across any hardware.  
- Integrated automation with telemetry databases to generate workflows.  
- Incorporated monitoring with **iostat, vmstat, sar, netstat, stress-ng, and pytest**.  
- Established **robust regression pipelines** for continuous validation across releases.  
- Applied **shift-left testing**, integrating automation coverage from feature inception.  

## Stress, Resiliency & Chaos Testing  
- Automated **stress and longevity tests**, validating vCenter at and beyond scale limits.  
- Simulated **CPU, memory, I/O, and network stress** scenarios to test fault tolerance.  
- Conducted **chaos and resiliency testing** using stress-ng, Chaos Monkey, and custom fault-injection scripts.  
- Identified and fixed **resource leaks, bottlenecks, and recovery gaps**, enhancing product stability.  

## Observability & Monitoring  
- Implemented observability solutions using **OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack**.  
- Built **real-time dashboards** for CI/CD pipelines, regressions, and system health.  
- Enabled faster **failure identification, debugging, and trend analysis** for engineering teams.  

## Collaboration & Leadership  
- Partnered with **Product Managers** to align testing with customer use cases.  
- Collaborated with **Development Engineers** for early feature validation.  
- Coordinated with **Program Managers** to meet release schedules without quality compromise.  
- Supported **Customer Support** in reproducing/debugging customer issues.  

## Quality & Root Cause Analysis (RCA)  
- Owned and resolved **bug escapes** with thorough RCA.  
- Expanded automation coverage to close validation gaps.  
- Established a **continuous improvement cycle**, reducing repeat issues and improving release confidence.  

## CI/CD & Pipeline Design  
- Designed **parameterized CI/CD pipelines** in Jenkins for flexible execution.  
- Automated **build triggers, regression runs, stress/chaos tests, and reporting**.  
- Reduced validation turnaround time **from days to hours** with parallel execution strategies.  
- Enhanced pipeline resilience with **retry mechanisms, flaky test isolation, and graceful error handling**.
