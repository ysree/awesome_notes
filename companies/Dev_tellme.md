Professional Summary

    Staff Engineer with 18 years of experience, including 9 years at VMware in the System Test team.

    Specialized in Quality Assurance (QA), automation, and large-scale vCenter system validation.

    Deep expertise in vCenter scale, greenfield deployments, feature validation, uptime stress, performance benchmarking, and resiliency testing at enterprise scale.

    Proven track record of designing robust automation frameworks, resilient CI/CD pipelines, and observability solutions that improve reliability, scalability, and customer confidence.

Key Contributions
Automation & Frameworks

Designed and implemented end-to-end automation frameworks covering regression, performance, stress, scalability, and resiliency testing of vCenter systems.

Developed a Kubernetes-based workflow orchestration engine for greenfield deployments on any hardware.

Enabled workflow creation from telemetry databases.

Incorporated monitoring frameworks using iostat, vmstat, sar, netstat, stress-ng, and pytest.

Built robust regression pipelines ensuring continuous validation across multiple releases and environments.

Applied shift-left testing principles, integrating automation coverage from the start of feature development.

Stress, Resiliency & Chaos Testing

Automated stress and longevity tests, pushing vCenter systems to defined and beyond-limit scale.

Simulated CPU, memory, I/O, and network stress scenarios to validate fault tolerance and self-healing.

Conducted resiliency and chaos testing by inducing failures via stress-ng, Chaos Monkey, and custom fault-injection scripts.

Proactively uncovered resource leaks, bottlenecks, and recovery gaps, resulting in higher product stability and resilience under production-like workloads.

Observability & Monitoring

Implemented end-to-end observability solutions with OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Prometheus, and ELK stack.

Built real-time dashboards for CI/CD pipelines, regression executions, and vCenter system health.

Enabled faster failure identification, proactive debugging, and trend analysis for engineering teams.

Collaboration & Leadership

Partnered with Product Managers to align validation with customer scenarios and real-world use cases.

Collaborated with Development Engineers for early feature testing and automation integration.

Coordinated with Program Managers to meet release schedules without compromising quality.

Assisted Customer Support by reproducing and debugging customer-reported issues.

Quality & Root Cause Analysis

Owned and resolved bug escapes through comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

Closed coverage gaps by enhancing automation scripts and expanding regression suites.

Established a continuous improvement cycle, reducing repeat issues and boosting customer confidence in releases.

CI/CD & Pipeline Design

Designed parameterized, configurable CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.

Automated build triggering, regression execution, stress testing, chaos testing, log collection, and reporting.

Implemented parallel execution strategies, reducing validation turnaround time from days to hours.

Built resilient pipelines with retry mechanisms, diagnostic log capture, flaky test isolation, and graceful error handling.
