# RCE in Detailed explanation

I am responsible for **development of lifecycle management service, maintenance, and upgrading customer SDDCs every 6 months** with minimal disruption.

To manage this complex process, we developed two key services:

- **RCE (Release Coordination Engine)**: Automates coordination of tasks and dependencies across teams for smooth upgrades and post-upgrade validation.  
- **RLCM (SDDC Lifecycle Management)**: Manages the end-to-end SDDC upgrade process, including scheduling, execution.

These services allow my team to **orchestrate the entire upgrade process**, minimize downtime, and improve operational efficiency.

When a bundle is available we notify customers to choose predefined maintenance windows. Based on customer selections, we schedule and execute upgrades in a phased manner to minimize disruption.

# RCE explanation
- **Planning**: Analyze SDDC versions, dependencies, and customer environment; define upgrade waves.  
- **Execution**: Automate upgrades with RCE and RLCM, coordinate across teams, and monitor progress.  
- **Post-Upgrade Validation**: Ensure workloads are functioning normally, verify system stability, and capture metrics for continuous improvement.

- **Waved Rollout**:
We follow a Wave based Rollouts to upgrade customer SDDC's
  - **Wave 1**: Internal VMware SDDCs only
  - **Wave 2**: Smaller SDDCs with simple configurations
  - **Wave 3**: Large customer SDDCs with complex configurations

- **Automated & Monitored**: 
These rollouts are monitored by SRE teams, creating proactive support tickets if issues arise.
---

## 3. Phased Upgrade Approach
The SDDC upgrade is executed in **three phases** to minimize disruption:

### Phase 1: Control Plane Update
- **Actions**: Update vCenter Server and NSX Edges; backup management appliances; update certificates if needed.
- **Impact**: Temporary vCenter and NSX Manager downtime; NSX Edge failover downtime. Workloads continue normally.

### Phase 2: Rolling Host Upgrades
- **Actions**: Update ESXi hosts and networking software; add temporary non-billable host; sequential updates using vMotion and DRS.
- **Impact**: Continuous workload operation; minimal service disruption.

### Phase 3: NSX Appliance Update
- **Actions**: Update NSX appliances; backup prior to updates.
- **Impact**: Temporary vCenter/NSX Manager access unavailability; workloads remain operational.

---

## 4. Scheduling and Notifications
- **Notifications**: Customers informed via email and Cloud Console.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Customers can request alternate maintenance windows and influence SDDC upgrade order.
- **Customer Guidance**: Avoid migrations, storage vMotion, or storage policy changes; maintain >20% slack space in clusters.

---

## 5. Firmware Updates
- **Automated Process**: EC2 instance firmware updated automatically in a non-disruptive workflow.
- **Method**: Add temporary non-billable host, migrate workloads, reboot host for firmware, restore host online, remove temporary host.

- **Leverage existing systems:** Use tools like **RCE (Release Coordination Engine)** and **BRS (Backup & Restore Service)** for fast rollback or restore capabilities.  
- **Balance speed and accuracy:** Prioritize fast workarounds with clear communication over waiting for perfect solutions.  

**Example:** NSX Edge incident resolution  

**Actions taken:** Executed rollback plan using BRS, restored SDDC state, resumed operations within SLA, and continuously updated the customer throughout the process.  

---

## 3. Prevention & Continuous Improvement
- **Blameless postmortem:** Focus on what went wrong in process or system rather than assigning blame.  
- **Process updates:** Revise runbooks, adjust rollout criteria, and improve automation based on learnings.  
- **Customer feedback loop:** Ensure customers see improvements to build trust and confidence.  

**Example:** Post-NSX Edge incident improvements  

**Outcomes:** Updated wave rollout criteria to identify high-risk configurations earlier, improved monitoring and alerting, and communicated enhancements to the customer to demonstrate learning and proactive prevention.

# Handling On-Call Responsibilities

‚ÄúYes, currently I manage a globally distributed team ‚Äî 7 members including a manager in the US, and 11 engineers in India. Handling on-call responsibilities effectively is a key part of maintaining operational excellence.  

## üîπ Follow-the-Sun Model
- Leveraged our global presence to reduce fatigue and improve response times.  
- India team covers daytime IST hours, US team covers daytime PST hours.  
- Most incidents are addressed during working hours, minimizing after-hours disruptions.  

## üîπ Rotation & Fairness
- Weekly rotation system within each geography; every engineer is on-call for one week, backed by a secondary on-call to avoid single points of failure.  
- Managers, including myself, are part of the escalation ladder but not in primary rotation ‚Äî stepping in only for severe incidents or cross-team coordination.  

## üîπ Runbooks & Automation
- Invested heavily in **runbooks and automation**.  
- Recurring incidents (e.g., upgrade rollouts or NSX alerts) automated via **RCE (Release Coordination Engine)** and **BRS (Backup & Restore Service)**.  
- Reduces repetitive manual work, allowing engineers to focus on high-value investigations.  

## üîπ Escalation Management
- Maintain a **global escalation bridge** with SRE and product teams for high-severity incidents.  
- Time zone handoffs documented in Jira/Slack to ensure continuity.  
- **Example:** During a large-scale SDDC upgrade wave, if an incident started in IST hours but wasn‚Äôt resolved by EOD India, the US team seamlessly continued handling it using a detailed handoff checklist.  

## üîπ Operational Metrics & Continuous Improvement
- Track metrics like **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)**, incident frequency, and on-call load per engineer.  
- Adjusted training and knowledge-sharing sessions to balance load when some engineers handle more critical incidents.  
- Automation and improved observability reduced PagerDuty alert noise by ~30%, directly improving on-call experience.

[üîù](#table-of-contents)

# Handling Good and Underperformers

I handle **team performance management** with three priorities: **Recognition & Growth, Support & Development, and Accountability**  

## 1. Good Performers ‚Äì Recognition & Growth

**Example:** A high-performing engineer in RCE development consistently delivered automation features ahead of schedule.  
**Actions taken:** Recognized in team meetings, assigned as technical lead for a major upgrade wave, and involved in mentoring junior engineers.  

## 2. Underperformers ‚Äì Support & Development
- **Identify root cause:** Determine if issues are due to skill gaps, motivation, workload, or personal challenges.  
- **Clear expectations:** Set measurable goals and timelines; share what success looks like.  
- **Provide support:** Offer training, mentoring, and pair with strong performers to improve skills and confidence.  
- **Frequent check-ins:** Monitor progress, provide constructive feedback, and adjust support as needed.  

**Example:** An engineer was missing deadlines in RLCM upgrade workflows.  
**Actions taken:** Conducted one-on-one discussions to identify gaps, provided hands-on mentorship, paired with a senior engineer, and set clear deliverable targets. Performance improved steadily.  

## 3. Accountability ‚Äì Balancing Performance
- **Document performance:** Track achievements, missed goals, and feedback; maintain transparency with HR and leadership.  
- **Decision on retention:** If performance does not improve despite support, initiate a structured Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or transition out professionally.  
- **Ensure fairness:** Use a blameless, data-driven approach focusing on behaviors and outcomes rather than personal traits.  

**Example:** After multiple mentoring sessions, if an engineer continues to underperform in critical RCE maintenance tasks, a structured PIP is used with clear improvement goals.  

## Outcome
- Motivates **high performers** to grow and contribute strategically.  
- Supports **underperformers** with structured guidance and opportunity for improvement.  
- Maintains a **high-performing team culture** aligned with business goals and customer impact.

**Example:**  
During an RLCM enhancement project, two engineers disagreed on the **approach to implement automated rollback for failed SDDC upgrade steps**:  

- **Engineer A** advocated for a **full rollback of all upgrade steps** in case of any failure to ensure maximum safety but was concerned about time overhead.  
- **Engineer B** suggested a **partial rollback**, only for the failed component, to minimize downtime but worried it might leave dependencies in inconsistent states.  

**Resolution Process:**  
1. I held a **private session** with both engineers to fully understand their rationale.  
2. Organized a **joint discussion**, using whiteboarding to visualize both approaches, highlighting risks, dependencies, and operational impact.  
3. Guided them to evaluate **customer impact, SLA adherence, and system complexity**.

# Managing Conflicts with other Team

## Approach to Conflict Management

- **Open Communication**: I encourage team members to voice concerns in a safe environment. I initiate one-on-one or team discussions to understand all perspectives, ensuring everyone feels heard. This aligns with my experience leading distributed teams across time zones, where asynchronous communication was key.
- **Identify Root Causes**: I analyze the conflict‚Äôs source using data or feedback. For instance, during the VMware Cloud on AWS project, I noticed tension between developers and SRE teams over rollout delays during the six-month release cadence.
- **Mediation and Neutrality**: I act as a neutral mediator, facilitating dialogue to find common ground. In the rollout delay conflict, I held a meeting where both sides explained their constraints‚Äîdevelopers pushed for faster releases, while SREs emphasized stability.
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: I involve the team in crafting solutions, leveraging their expertise. We agreed on a phased approach adjustment, adding more pre-rollout testing, which reduced errors by 15% and eased tensions, reflecting my work on wave-based deployment strategies.
- **Set Clear Expectations**: I establish actionable steps and timelines to prevent recurrence. Post-resolution, I updated runbooks and CI/CD workflows, ensuring better coordination, similar to how I refined processes for the 60% cost-saving Nimbus solution.
- **Follow-Up and Support**: I check in regularly to ensure the resolution holds and offer support. After the rollout adjustment, I mentored both teams on observability tools like Grafana, improving platform health by 30% and fostering trust.

## Example

- During the VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC upgrade project, a conflict arose when a developer‚Äôs accelerated CI/CD pipeline deployment clashed with SREs‚Äô maintenance schedules, causing unplanned downtime. I stepped in, gathered input via a team call, identified the mismatch in priorities (speed vs. stability), and mediated a compromise. We implemented a pre-deployment validation phase, which I oversaw using Jenkins automation. This reduced downtime incidents by 20% over the next cycle, and the teams collaborated more effectively thereafter. This experience reinforced my belief in addressing conflicts proactively to maintain team harmony and project success.

This approach ensures conflicts are resolved constructively, aligning with my commitment to technical depth and collaborative leadership.

# Incident Management

## What is Incident Management?  
Incident Management is the **process of identifying, logging, categorizing, prioritizing, investigating, resolving, and closing incidents** (unplanned service interruptions or performance degradations).  

The goal is simple:  
‚û°Ô∏è **Detect fast ‚Üí Respond fast ‚Üí Restore service quickly ‚Üí Learn and prevent recurrence**.  

---

## Key Steps in Incident Management  

1. **Detection & Logging**  
   - Incidents are detected via monitoring tools (Prometheus, CloudWatch, vROps), user reports, or automated alerts.  
   - Every incident is logged in an ITSM tool (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira Service Management).  

2. **Categorization & Prioritization**  
   - Categorize by type (network, compute, storage, application).  
   - Prioritize by severity/impact (e.g., Sev-1 = critical service outage, Sev-4 = minor issue).  

3. **Assignment**  
   - Incident is routed to the right support/engineering/SRE team for resolution.  

4. **Investigation & Diagnosis**  
   - Teams analyze logs, metrics, and alerts.  
   - Use runbooks, knowledge base, and automation for faster triage.  

5. **Resolution & Recovery**  
   - Fix is applied (e.g., restart pod, failover node, rollback release, patch dependency).  
   - Service is restored to normal operating state.  

6. **Closure**  
   - Confirm service stability with monitoring and customer validation.  
   - Incident is formally closed in the system.  

7. **Post-Incident Review (PIR) / Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**  
   - For major incidents, a retrospective is done.  
   - Identify root cause, contributing factors, and preventive measures (e.g., update runbook, add alerts, improve CI/CD checks).  

---

## Key Metrics for Incident Management  

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)** | Avg. time to detect an incident. | <10 min |
| **MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge)** | Avg. time for team to acknowledge after detection. | <5 min |
| **MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve)** | Avg. time to restore service. | <30 min (critical) |
| **Incident Volume** | Total number of incidents in a period. | Trend downwards |
| **Repeat Incidents** | % of recurring issues. | As low as possible |

---

## Example (VMware Cloud on AWS ‚Äì RCE/RLCM Context)  

- **Detection**: Monitoring shows API error rate >5% in RCE. PagerDuty triggers alert.  
- **Categorization**: Incident categorized as ‚ÄúService Reliability ‚Äì API Failure‚Äù. Severity = Sev-1 (impacting tenant upgrades).  
- **Assignment**: Routed to RCE Dev + SRE team.  
- **Diagnosis**: Logs show dependency latency in Fleet Management service.  
- **Resolution**: Applied retry/backoff fix + scaled API pods. Workflow resumed.  
- **Closure**: Customers informed via status page; incident closed in ServiceNow.  
- **Post-mortem**: RCA shows missing alert for Fleet API latency ‚Üí action item to add monitoring in next sprint.  

---

‚úÖ In short: **Incident Management is about speed, coordination, and learning**. It ensures service uptime, protects SLAs, and builds customer trust.
