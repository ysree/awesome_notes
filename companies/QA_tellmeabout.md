### **Answer:**

**Situation:**
In VMware Cloud on AWS, one of the major challenges we faced was the **high cost of AWS resource consumption** across multiple environments — including **development, testing, and product validation**. Each team spun up real AWS resources for validation and integration testing, which led to **significant cloud costs** every month.
As an individual contributor in the Orchestration Fabric platform team, I wanted to find a sustainable way to reduce this recurring expense without affecting productivity or test quality.

---

**Task:**
My goal was to **optimize AWS resource usage** across all teams by providing a **realistic, low-cost alternative** to using live AWS infrastructure during testing and development. The challenge was to maintain functional parity with AWS APIs while keeping the implementation transparent for all existing services.

---

**Action:**

1. I came up with an **idea to intercept all AWS API calls** made by VMC services and **redirect them to an internally hosted mock service**, instead of calling the real AWS endpoints.
2. We used **Moto**, an open-source AWS mocking framework, as the base, but extended it heavily to **simulate realistic AWS behaviors** such as provisioning, state transitions, and error scenarios.
3. The mock service mimicked AWS resource creation inside **VMware’s private cloud**, returning **identical responses** to real AWS APIs — so no code changes were required in client services.
4. This entire feature was made **configurable via a feature flag**, allowing teams to toggle between real AWS and mock AWS seamlessly.
5. I presented the idea to the **Office of the CTO**, where the **VP of Engineering approved it** with dedicated budget and resources for implementation.
6. I led the **end-to-end design, development, testing, and rollout**, ensuring integration with multiple VMC microservices and CI pipelines.
7. We validated correctness using **A/B testing** and **functional regression** to ensure results from the mock service matched real AWS API responses.

---

**Result:**

* The solution achieved a **60% reduction in overall AWS cloud costs** across development, QA, and product teams.
* The **mock AWS service** became a **mandatory standard** for all internal environments to minimize external cloud usage.
* The success of this initiative was recognized at the **organizational level**, and I was awarded the **VMware PCS Star Award** for innovation and cost optimization.
* This project not only reduced expenses but also **improved developer agility**, since provisioning mock resources became **instantaneous** and **network-isolated**.
* Today, the system continues to serve as a **core testing utility** across VMware Cloud teams.

---

### **Closing Line (for interview delivery):**

> “This project stands out for me because it combined innovation, technical depth, and measurable business impact. A simple idea of mocking AWS interactions internally ended up saving millions annually and became a company-wide standard — proving how engineering creativity can directly drive business outcomes.”

# A Day in My Role as a QA in vSphere System Test:

My day usually starts with reviewing the health of ongoing automation runs from the previous night — checking dashboards, logs, and CI reports to identify any failures or regressions in large-scale vCenter test environments.

Next, I triage issues, analyze logs, and work closely with developers to isolate root causes — whether it’s a product defect, infrastructure issue, or test gap.

I spend part of my day enhancing or creating automation scripts and test workflows, especially for new vCenter or ESXi features, ensuring that they’re validated at scale under different configurations.

I also focus on maintaining and improving our test frameworks and CI/CD pipelines to make test execution more resilient and efficient.

Toward the latter part of the day, I participate in sync meetings or design discussions with cross-functional teams — product developers, feature QA, and performance teams — to align on priorities, test coverage, and upcoming feature readiness.

Sometimes, I work on setting up or debugging large test topologies — multi-vCenter setups, cluster upgrades, or cross-vCenter scenarios — to ensure real-world coverage.

So overall, my day is a mix of analysis, automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement — all focused on ensuring that vSphere delivers reliability and scalability at enterprise level.

# Challenge you came across as a QA in STAR model

**Situation**
As a QA engineer specializing in VMware vSphere environments, I recently led a stress testing project for a large-scale vCenter setup managing 2500 ESXi hosts. The goal was to simulate an extreme workload by running 1000 parallel vMotion operations across these hosts. This was part of validating scalability for a major enterprise client upgrading to vSphere 8. However, right from the initial runs, we hit massive failure rates—over 60% of vMotions were timing out or failing due to resource contention and concurrency overloads, which threatened to delay the entire certification timeline.

**Task**
My primary responsibility was to diagnose the root causes of these failures, implement fixes to stabilize the tests, and ensure we could complete the full 1000-vMotion batch without compromising the environment's integrity. This involved coordinating with the dev and infra teams to minimize downtime while adhering to VMware best practices, all within a tight two-week window before the client demo.

**Action**
I started by categorizing failures using vCenter's Tasks & Events logs and PowerCLI scripts to export and analyze errors—quickly pinpointing concurrency limits (e.g., only 8 per host) and network saturation as the top culprits. I aggregated logs from hosts via vRealize Log Insight and used esxtop in real-time to monitor CPU, memory, and network bottlenecks.
To address this, I throttled the operations: reduced maxCostPerHost to 4 in vpxd.cfg and staggered migrations in batches of 100 using a PowerCLI script like $vms | ForEach-Object { Move-VM -VM $_ -Destination ($hosts | Get-Random) -RunAsync -ThrottleLimit 100 }. For network issues, I enabled Multi-NIC vMotion on dedicated 10GbE ports, set MTU to 9000, and isolated traffic via VLANs. I also enabled EVC on the cluster to fix CPU compatibility mismatches and reserved resources on high-load hosts to prevent memory contention. Throughout, I documented everything in a shared wiki for team handoff and ran iterative test cycles, adjusting based on metrics like task queue depth and IOPS latency.

**Result**
By the end of the week, failure rates dropped to under 5%, allowing us to successfully execute the full 1000 parallel vMotions in under 4 hours with zero environment crashes. This not only met our deadline but also uncovered a vCenter tuning recommendation that we fed back to VMware's engineering team, leading to an updated KB article. The client was thrilled, and it boosted our team's confidence for even larger-scale tests ahead.
