# Tell Me About Yourself â€“ Staff QA Automation Engineer

## Professional Summary

- **Staff Engineer** with **18 years of software engineering experience**, including the last **9 years at VMware** in the ** vSphere System Test team**.  
- Specialized in **quality assurance (QA), automation, and large-scale vCenter system validation**.  
- Expertise in **vCenter scale, greenfield deployments, feature validations, uptime stress, performance, and resiliency testing** at scale.  
- Involved in designing **automation frameworks, resilient CI/CD pipelines, and observability solutions**.  

## Key Contributions

### QA Automation & Frameworks
- Designed and implemented **end-to-end automation frameworks** covering regression, performance, stress, scalability, monitoring, and resiliency testing of vCenter systems.  
- Developed a self service **Kubernetes-based workflow orchestration engine** for greenfield deployments that runs and validates on any hardware.  
  - Scales and validates vCenter systems as per the defined limits.  
  - Discover workflows and operations based on **day-2 user operations** from telemetry databases.  
  - Simulated **CPU, memory, I/O, and network stress scenarios** to validate **fault tolerance**.  
  - Uncovered **resource leaks, performance bottlenecks** under production-like workloads.  
  - Built **regression pipelines** ensuring continuous validation across multiple releases and environments.  
  - Automated **build triggering, regression execution, stress testing, log collection, and reporting**.
  - Applied **shift-left testing principles**, integrating automation coverage from the start of feature development.  
 

### Observability & Monitoring
- Implemented monitoring frameworks using **iostat, vmstat, sar, netstat, stress-ng**, and **pytest**, avoiding third-party agents installation in vCenter.  
- Implemented **end-to-end observability solutions** with **Grafana, Prometheus, and ELK stack**. 
- Developed pipelines that can **automatically trigger builds, run regression suites, execute stress tests, collect logs and metrics, and report results in a unified real-time dashboard** and vCenter system health.  
- Improved **failure identification, debugging efficiency** 

### Collaboration & Leadership
- Worked closely with **Product Managers** to align validation with customer scenarios and real-world use cases.  
- Collaborated with **Development Engineers** for early feature testing and automation integration.  
- Coordinated with **Program Managers** to meet release schedules without compromising quality.  
- Assisted **Customer Support teams** by reproducing and debugging **customer-reported issues**.  

### Quality & Root Cause Analysis
- Owned and resolved **bug escapes** through comprehensive **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**.  
- Identified coverage gaps, enhanced automation scripts, and updated regression suites.  

### Tools & Technologies
- **CI/CD & Automation:** Jenkins, Git, Python, Groovy, Shell scripts
- **Containers & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Resilience & Chaos Testing:** stress-ng, custom fault-injection scripts  
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack  
- **Tools** iostat, vmstat, sar, netstat, top
