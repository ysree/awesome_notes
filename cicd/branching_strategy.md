# Branching Strategy

> “In my experience, a well-defined branching strategy is essential for **collaboration, continuous integration, and smooth deployments**.  
> I usually follow a strategy similar to **GitFlow** or a simplified version depending on the team size and release cycle. Here’s how I explain it:

---

## Main / Master Branch
- This is the **production-ready branch**. Only fully tested and approved code is merged here.
- Every commit here triggers **deployment pipelines for production (CI/CD).**

---

## Develop Branch
- Used for integrating **features that are ready for the next release.**
- **CI pipelines** ensure all merged code passes automated unit and integration tests before merging.

---

## Feature Branches
- Created from `develop` for each **new feature or task.**
- Named like `feature/feature-name`.
- Developers work independently and **merge back to `develop`** after code review and passing tests.

---

## Release Branches
- Created from `develop` when preparing a **new release.**
- Used for **final testing, bug fixes, and versioning.**
- After release, merged into **both `main` and `develop`.**

---

## Hotfix Branches
- Created from `main` to **quickly fix production issues.**
- After fix, merged back into **`main` and `develop`** to keep code synchronized.
- Ensures **fast resolution without disrupting ongoing development.**

---

## Tagging / Versioning
- Every release on `main` is **tagged with a version number** (e.g., `v1.2.0`) for traceability.
